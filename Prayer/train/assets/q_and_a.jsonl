{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Come on. Let's go.", "output": "This facility is why your friend Yahiro sold you three out. You'll realize not everything is black and white."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Yahiro was a drug dealer who went by the alias Sugar. He was said to be at the Roppongi blockade that day selling Norma Gene.", "output": "That’s how he found out about my Funeral Parlor affiliation."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Correct, Shu. However, Yahiro had his reason to turn you over to us.", "output": "What he sells is dirty money, but Yahiro's motives are pure. Look down there and you'll see."}

{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "What happened to these people?", "output": "Yahiro?"}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Who is that kid Yahiro's with?", "output": "That's his younger brother Jun. That's why Yahiro ratted you out. This is what happens when the Apocalypse Virus reaches stage four."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "This facility's role is GHQ's effort to provide medical attention for people infected or immune to the vaccine.", "output": "Ten years ago the pandemic ravaged our country. GHQ developed the vaccine and suppressed the outbreak. Health care came at a cost. Yahiro raised money selling Norma Gene to cover treatment expenses. After Lost Christmas, GHQ changed Japan's health care system, profiting off the Apocalypse Virus while accelerating breakthroughs."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "So, I can't forgive Funeral Parlor. Not when they disrupt the peace we worked to create.", "output": "Yet I can't wrap my head around you three, especially you Shu. You two were just classmates caught in the wrong place at the wrong time."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "We only saw Shu talking with Yahiro.", "output": "Listen, my brother and I shouldn't even be here. Shu is the one you want. Just don't hurt him."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "After we're done, we might release you. Until then you'll stay put. And I won't let anything happen to Shu.", "output": "Look at that, Shu. You have friends who care. You seem like a smart kid who cares about people. Why dismantle our goodwill?"}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Goodwill? How can you say that? With what I saw, that wasn't goodwill.", "output": "I don't quite follow."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "I saw innocent people killed by your men! What about that monster in secrecy?! Such a thing shouldn't exist!", "output": "That was a hideout for unregistered citizens. They refused inoculations and it became a hotbed for infection."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "That doesn't make it right! And what about that monster in the GHQ truck that attacked us?", "output": "That beast was a last defense measure. Science produces things the public isn't aware of."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "If what I'm hearing is true, then he's right! That's cruel! You can't take innocent lives like that!", "output": "It's okay, sis."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Our soldiers were killed too. They're far from their families. Did you think they wanted to die protecting people who refuse to protect themselves?", "output": "Gai said we had to save the civilians. He said it was for the greater good."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Is that what he said? Why is he trying to free a mass murderer?", "output": "Kido Kenji, the man behind the Sky Tree Bombings. Funeral Parlor intends to take him by force. Him, not you, Shu."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "No, that can't be right. They're coming for me too. They wouldn't abandon me!", "output": "Listen, Shu. When someone tells you to be selfless, it serves them."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "Why are you giving him a pen?", "output": "It's not just a pen. It's a transmitter. Next time you're with Tsutsugami Gai, press blue twice and red once. We'll move in before they cause harm. We also know about Yuzuriha Inori."}
{"instruction": "dialogue", "input": "What? You got something on her too?", "output": "Most know her as a musician online. Sadly, she's caught in Gai's deception. If you refuse to help, I'll have no choice but to bring her in for questioning."}

{"instruction": "Introduce yourself as the lawyer to the group", "input": "You three must be Shu, Heath, and Akiko!", "output": "Shu, your mother hired me as a lawyer as a legal defense. I'm going to do everything I can to get you out of here."}
{"instruction": "Respond to the lawyer introducing himself as Mason", "input": "And don't worry I'll make sure you two get out of here as quickly as possible so your family won't realize you were even here. Oh, where are my manners? My name is Mason!", "output": "Oh my gosh, Gai…!"}
{"instruction": "React to the lawyer saying it's time for business", "input": "Let's get down to business!", "output": "They don't give much time for consultation, so we'll have to work out."}

{"instruction": "Confirm Gai is helping but explain the plan", "input": "He's not a terrorist, guys. He's going to get us out of here. Right, Gai?", "output": "Yes, but we need to act fast. Shu, we need to get these two to safety since they're innocent bystanders who got caught up in our conflict. We should take them back home once we escape. In the meantime, we also need to free a certain somebody."}
{"instruction": "React to hearing Kido Kenji's name", "input": "You mean Kido Kenji? The mass murderer involved with the Sky Tree Bombings? Why him?", "output": "That's the one but how would you know that?"}
{"instruction": "Respond to concern about freeing a mass murderer", "input": "Segai told us. Don't you think that's dangerous business freeing a mass murderer?", "output": "It is, but sometimes calculated risks are necessary to bring down GHQ's operations. Look, we don't have time to discuss a prisoner's morals when we should get you three out first. Oogumo and the others are already on standby ready to attack. Kido's in solitary. When we help him escape, I want you to meet him and draw out his Void, Shu."}
