# I(d) rules

    only increase the d if the model doesn't stabilized,
    you only stop when the series becomes stationary — meaning:
    - The mean is flat (no upward/downward drift).
    - The variance looks stable.
    - No obvious trend remains.

# for getting the 2nd d

    you subtract what you got from the diff
    example:

    ``` python

    # Original series:
    [10,12,15,19] 

    # First difference (d=1):
    [12-10,
     15-12,
     19-15] = [2,3,4]

    # Second difference (d=2):
    [3-2,
     4-3] = [1,1]
    ```

# how to use the other d?

    in ARIMA(), there's a p, d, and q, ARIMA(p, d, q)
    if you have multiple d, just choose one, if you have
    d1, d2, d3, choose one of it and put in arima
    example:

    ``` python
    ARIMA(p, d2, q)
    ```
