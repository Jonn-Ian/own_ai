Jesus Raymond R. Mijares
Chief Librarian
Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila
General Luna, corner Muralla St, Intramuros, Manila, 1002 Metro Manila

Dear Mr. Mijares,

As part of the curriculum of the College of Information Systems and Technology Management of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM-CISTM), we are requiring students from the Information Technology Department to undergo 486-hour training for the purpose of developing their skills through actual exposure in their line of specialization and observing how related problems can be solved. This is incorporated into our curriculum because we believe that it will make our graduates responsive to the needs of the industry. Consequently, we are requiring your support and the most relevant exposure for our IT professionals, as well as to ensure the continuity of the supply of highly qualified professionals.

In this regard, I would like to recommend Jonn Ian B. Sabar, a fourth year (4th year) Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BS IT) student to undergo the immersion in your department starting February 18, 2025.

We trust that this letter will merit your kind consideration and wholehearted support.

Thank you very much.


Truly yours,


PROF. ARIEL ANTWAUN ROLANDO C. SISON
Practicum (Immersion) Adviser
