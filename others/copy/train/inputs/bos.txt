I. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
Recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.) have completely changed a number of industries, including the fitness and health sectors. The creation of algorithms for form assessment in gym settings is a notable use of AI in this field. In order to maximize the advantages of workouts and reduce the risk of injury, a proper form throughout exercises is essential. Conventional techniques for evaluating forms, such trainers' manual observations, may be subjective and susceptible to human interpretation.

Moreover, with the help of AI-Powered Form Assessment for Optimal Gym Workouts offers a solution by leveraging computer vision and sensor technologies to provide objective and real-time feedback on exercise techniques. the system will analyze the form of the user and will be evaluated by the system by comparing the data points against established guidelines.

AI integration in form evaluation improves overall fitness and helps prevent injuries in addition to making gym routines more effective. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the design and application of AI-powered form evaluation systems in gym environments in order to advance fitness technology research and practice. This study intends to investigate the state of AI in form evaluation at the moment, analyze its efficacy, and make suggestions for its useful implementation in improving workouts at the gym.
