                                PREFACE


Celtic studies have grown apace within recent years. The old scorn, the
old apathy and neglect are visibly giving way to a lively wonder and
interest as the public gradually realise that scholars have lighted upon
a literary treasure hid for ages. This new enthusiasm, generated in
great part on the Continent—in Germany, France, and Italy, as well as in
Britain and Ireland, has already spread to the northern nations—to
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and is now beginning to take root in
America.

A remarkable change it certainly presents from the days when Dr. Johnson
affirmed that there was not in all the world a Gaelic MS. one hundred
years old; and the documents were so derelict and forgotten, so little
known and studied, that though this prince of letters travelled in the
Highlands expressly to satisfy himself, Celtic knowledge of the existing
materials and Celtic studies were so deficient that they proved wholly
inadequate to the task of disproving his bold statement.

It was left to the scholarship of the nineteenth century to unearth the
ancient treasures and to show that Gaelic was a literary language long
before English literature came into existence, and that there are still
extant Celtic-Latin MSS. almost as old as the very oldest codexes of the
Bible.

There is undoubtedly a charm in the thought that all over the Continent
of Europe, in the libraries of many of its romantic cities and towns,
there are scores of MSS., some of them upwards of a thousand years old,
fugitives in the early times from these much harassed islands; and that
European scholars of the highest erudition, such as Zeuss, Ebel, Nigra,
Ascoli, Windisch, Zimmer, and Whitley Stokes, have been profoundly
interested in these literary relics, and have devoted much of their time
to the work of studying, translating, elucidating, and editing the
Gaelic texts or glosses found in them.

To-day the number of those engaged in similar research at home and
abroad is vastly on the increase, and augurs well for the future of this
department of knowledge.

Professor Kuno Meyer, Ph.D., himself a distinguished German Celticist,
in reviewing the present state of Celtic studies last year at Dublin,
made the following significant statement:—

“I cannot conclude without casting a glance into the future. I am
convinced that the present is but the beginning of an era of still
greater activity in all departments of Celtic studies. Everything points
to that.

“The more reliable text-books and hand-books will be published, the
greater will be the numbers of those taking up Celtic studies. As the
fields of other more ancient and more recognised studies become
exhausted, there will come a rush of students on to the fresh, and
often, almost virgin soil of Celtic research, to study the great Celtic
civilisation at its source, to collect the last lingering remnants of a
mighty tradition.

“Again and again it has happened during recent years that workers in
other subjects have in their researches finally been led on to the
Celtic soil, where lie the roots of much medieval lore, of many
institutions, of important phases of thought.

“And another thing, too, I will foretell. The re-discovery, as it were,
of ancient Celtic literature will not only arouse abroad a greater
interest in the Celtic nations, but it will lead to beneficial results
among those nations themselves.”

Mr. W. B. Yeats, in the _Treasury of Irish Poetry_, 1900, gives pen to
similar reflections and anticipations:—

“Modern poetry,” he writes, “grows weary of using over and over again
the personages and stories and metaphors that have come to us through
Greece and Rome, or from Wales and Brittany through the Middle Ages, and
has found new life in the Norse and German legends. The Irish legends in
popular tradition and in old Gaelic literature are more numerous and as
beautiful, and alone among great European legends have the beauty and
wonder of altogether new things. May one not say then, without saying
anything improbable, that they will have a predominant influence in the
coming century, and that their influence will pass through many
countries.”

The interest thus lately evolved in the literature of the Celts, who
were among the earliest inhabitants of the country, and whose blood
still courses in our British veins, has naturally awakened a desire in
many minds to know the nature and extent of the literary legacy they
have bequeathed—its substance and quality, and also to gain some
acquaintance with the opinions and results of recent scholarship on the
subject.

But, strange to say, notwithstanding the activity of Celticists, no book
has yet appeared which professes to give in short compass a general
survey of the whole field. There is thus, I venture to think, room for
such a volume as the present, which is intended to serve as a popular
introduction to the study of the literature. Containing, as it does, the
gist of two series of lectures which I delivered under the Maccallum
Bequest in the University of Glasgow during the sessions 1900–1 and
1901–2, it is now prepared and issued with a view to meeting the demands
not only of the general reader, but also of the private student in quest
of a guide to the original sources, the authorities, and books on the
subject.

In its preparation, in addition to the numerous published works
mentioned in the text, I have received valuable help from Professor
Mackinnon, Edinburgh University, and Dr. Alexander Macbain, Inverness,
both of whom supplied me not only with many of their printed papers
embodying the fruits of their own personal research, but also with other
useful information. To the former I am still further indebted for
interesting details regarding the life and work of several of the
scholars, and to Professor Rhys of Jesus College, Oxford, for kindly
reviewing in MS. form the chapter on Welsh Literature.

And, finally, I have to record my special indebtedness to the kind
assistance of my friend, Mr. David Mackeggie, M.A., whose knowledge of
Celtic history and literature is both extensive and accurate, and who,
besides giving me much suggestive aid in the preparation of the
lectures, read the proofs of this volume.

  THE TECHNICAL COLLEGE,
    GLASGOW, _May, 1902_.

  This volume has already appealed to so wide a circle of readers that a
  reprint is now called for; and it is very gratifying to the author to
  find that his confidence in the growing demand for a book of this kind
  has been amply justified.

  In the present reissue no alteration of the reprint has been required.

                               CHAPTER I
           THE ARRIVAL OF THE CELT IN HISTORY AND LITERATURE

  The Celts in primitive Europe—Advent in British Isles—Two
      branches—Observations of Cæsar and Tacitus—Main facts of
      Celtic progress on the Continent—A vast empire—Interview with
      Alexander the Great—Colony in Galatia—Cup of conquest
      full—Disintegration—The scattered remnants—Recent
      statistics—The ancient Celts as seen through Greek and Roman
      eyes—Literary awakening—Ogam writings—First men of
      letters—Earliest written Gaelic now extant—Modern linguistic
      discovery—The place of Celtic in the Aryan group.


Emerson, looking forth from the new time on the nations of Europe, gave
pen to the reflection, “The Celts are of the oldest blood in the world.
Some peoples are deciduous or transitory. Where are the Greeks? Where
the Etrurians? Where the Romans? But the Celts are an old family of
whose beginning there is no memory, and their end is likely to be still
more remote in the future, for they have endurance and productiveness—a
hidden and precarious genius.”

A sweeping statement withal, yet the thoughtful finding of an eminently
studious and dispassionate mind.

When the curtain lifts over primitive Europe, and authentic history
first begins, the Celts are already there, and loom formidable in the
heart of the Continent. Not the earliest inhabitants by any means;
archæology points to anterior races. These the ethnologists designate
according to the shape of their heads and supposed colour of their hair.
Their remains have been found in caves, and in what are known to science
as the Neolithic or Stone Age barrows. And they present types of
humanity widely differing from the succeeding so-called Aryans.[1] But
beyond their material survivals, and the people who were supposed to
have been descended from them, there is absolutely no record of these
vanished races. They belong to prehistoric times.

So do the Celts in great part, but unlike their predecessors they have
emerged in history, and projected themselves on its pages to this day.
They have stepped out of the impenetrable haze, and appear at the
opening of the written drama of Europe.

History finds them for the first time located about the upper reaches of
the Danube, in the lands corresponding to modern Bavaria, Wurtemburg,
Baden, and the country drained by the Maine to the east of the Rhine.
The idea of an ingress from Asia has lately been abandoned. Research
seems to have effectively exploded it.[2]

They were barbarians from our point of view, not savages; not civilised,
but apparently a good stage onward from earlier types. It was they who
gave names to many of the rivers and mountains of Europe—“names which
are poems,” says Matthew Arnold, “and which imitate the pure voices of
nature.”

Hyperboreans they seemed to have been called by the original Greeks, but
since the time of Hecatæus and Herodotus, that is, from about 500 B.C.,
they came to be known to the classic writers as κελται or κελτοι—a name
which at that early period the Greeks applied indiscriminately to all
the people of north and west Europe who were not Iberians.

To them, as well as to the Romans, all that stretch of the Continent
appeared to be occupied mainly by κελτοι. And though the Germans lived
from time immemorial beyond them in the north, not till the first
century B.C. did the Romans discover that they were a different people.
Cæsar himself was one of the earliest to observe and chronicle the fact.

But there were reasons for this apparent ubiquity of the Celts. Apart
from their chronic unrest and frequent migrations, we can well
understand why the Germans appeared merged in them. The Germans were
early deprived of their independence, and held in slavish subordination
till they recovered their freedom about 300 B.C. For centuries before
that date, conqueror and conquered apparently lived under a common
regime, obeying the same chiefs, and fighting in the same armies, though
generally in the relation of dominant masters and subject slaves. In
this way they even came to have many words in common, as their
respective languages show.

At what time the Celts entered Gaul, Britain, and Ireland is a question
unhappily beyond the knowledge of man. The seventh century B.C., or even
the tenth as the Irish tradition maintains, is given as an approximate
date. But of this there is no authentic record. Nor yet of a second
immigration assumed to have followed in the third century B.C.

That there were two such invasions of Britain with a considerable
interval between them is one of the pet theories of philology. For two
branches of an originally parent stock may be traced, known as the
Gadelic and the Brittonic, or more recently as the Q and P groups. The
one includes the Irish, Manx, and Gaelic-speaking peoples, and was the
earlier to arrive; the other embraces the Welsh, Cornish, and Breton,
who came later.

This linguistic fact might be represented tabularly, thus:—

                               Celtic
                                  |
                      +-----------+-----------+
                      |                       |
                   Gadelic                Brittonic
                      |                       |
               +------+------+        +-------+-------+
               |      |      |        |       |       |
             Irish  Manx  Gaelic    Welsh  Cornish  Breton

The main difference between those two branches is, that in Gadelic the
original guttural of the Aryan tongue came gradually to be _c_ with the
sound _k_, ogam _qu_, and that in Brittonic it became _p_. So we say:—

                   English  Gaelic    Welsh    Latin
                   Four    _c_eithir _p_edwar quatuor
                   Five    _c_oig    _p_imp   quinque

Such a distinction points to a great change from the common speech of
earlier Celtic times. It existed prior to the Christian era, and is
still strikingly in evidence. Edward Lhuyd, the illustrious Welsh
antiquary, writing in the early part of the eighteenth century, noted
that there were scarcely any words in the Irish that began with _p_,
beyond what were borrowed from Latin or some other language. So much was
this the case, that in an ancient alphabetical vocabulary which he had
beside him, the letter _p_ was entirely omitted. Other instances might
be given. For example, in O’Reilly’s Irish Dictionary, out of upwards of
700 pages, only twelve are occupied with that letter; and when we come
to examine the most recent Gaelic collection of words—the etymological
dictionary of Dr. Macbain—we find about 270 beginning with _p_ out of a
total of well over 7000; and even of these, the majority are derived or
borrowed from Norse or English. There is a MS. of the eighteenth century
in the Laing collection of Edinburgh University, which puts the case
succinctly, when in the sections of what promised to be a good Gaelic
grammar, it observes that of old no word, except _exotic_ words, began
in Gaelic with a _p_. Fastening on so characteristic a distinction
Professor Rhys, some years ago, decided to call the Brittonic the P, and
the Gadelic the Q group, as the more simple and fundamental
classification.

Thus far philology helps to differentiate between the two branches, and
points to a remote advent of the Gael in Britain.

But when we turn to history we find there is nothing definite on this
most attractive subject till Cæsar arrives and makes personal
observation. Speaking of the south—for he had not penetrated the
northern parts—he tells us that he found two races in possession: one in
the interior, which considered itself indigenous; the other on the
sea-coast, roving adventurers from the Continent who arrived later.
Tacitus, writing nearly a century and a half after Cæsar, namely, about
82 A.D., practically confirms Cæsar’s report of a double occupation, and
adds the further interesting details, that the one race was dark
complexioned and had curly hair, while the other, resembling the Gauls,
had red hair and were tall of stature. In the eighth century A.D. we
know, on the authority of Bede, that there were in these islands five
written languages, viz. those of the Angles, the Brythons, the Scottis,
the Picts, and the Latins, the first four[3] of which were spoken. It is
the ever-puzzling yet fascinating work of philology and ethnology to
trace the origin and exact racial connection of these—a work which
hitherto has proved as elusive as the finding of the North Pole. Who are
the dark complexioned race of the South? and who the Picts of the North?
are questions of perennial interest to the experts.

But though early British and German history is so elusive, we are on
sure ground with the main facts of Celtic progress on the Continent from
the fifth century B.C. Authentic history then opens with the advent of
the classical writers just at the time when the Celts were entering upon
a series of conquests which for the next 200 years made them the
dominant race in Europe.[4] It is needless to follow their various
migrations, even if it were possible. As their territories became
congested on the Danube, they sent forth horde after horde of conquering
tribes who surged every way. Now westward for the most part, till, in
the graphic language of Galgacus, uttered centuries after, “there was
now no nation beyond—nothing save the waves and the rocks” (Nulla jam
gens ultra; nihil nisi fluctus et saxa), then, like the back-rushing
tides, they receded eastwards.

“Tumults,” the Romans called these irrepressible outbursts, and most
felicitously too, for they were the terror of Europe.

A cursory glance at some of the more famous of their invasions suffices
to show the restless energy of the Celts and their far-reaching
conquests.

From Gaul, where they appear to have established themselves north of the
Garonne and about the Seine and Loire, the hungry tribes made a dash for
Spain, shortly before 500 B.C., and wrested the peninsula from the hands
of the Phœnicians. One hundred and twenty years later North Italy shared
the same fate. Surging through the passes of the Alps they overthrew the
Etruscans on their own ground in the great battle of Allia, 390 B.C.,
and annexed their territory. Flushed with the victory they pressed
forward, and within three days stormed and sacked the town of Rome
itself. Indeed, it is with this momentous incursion that authentic Roman
history begins.

One more mighty invasion of the East, and the Illyrians along the Danube
are vanquished, thus rendering the conquerors masters of a vast
territory extending from that river and the Adriatic to the Atlantic,
and bounded on the north by the Rhine and Mid-Germany, and on the south
by Mid-Italy and Mid-Spain, and including the British Isles—a
magnificent empire rivalling that of Alexander or of Cæsar in their
palmy days. Goldsmith’s lines might well apply to them—

              One only master grasps the whole domain,
              And half a tillage stints the smiling plain.

So formidable, indeed, were the Celts during the period of their
ascendency that it served the purpose of the classic nations—Greeks and
Romans—to keep the peace with them as best they could, and even to play
them off against their own hereditary foes. And so the expansive tribes
were for the most part on friendly terms with both, especially with the
Greeks. We have an account in Strabo of an interview which Alexander the
Great had with their ambassadors. It is given on the authority of
Ptolemy, his general. The young potentate knew well the advantage of
cultivating good fellowship with his powerful neighbours, and when the
tribes of the Adriatic sent delegates he received them with all due
courtesy and respect.

While they were drinking, says the general, Alexander asked them what
was the object of their greatest fear, thinking they would say himself.
But the imaginative Celts had quite other views. They feared no man. One
thing only alarmed them, they replied, and that was lest the heavens
should one day fall and crush them. Still, they added, that they valued
the friendship of such a man as he was above everything.

“How vainglorious these Celts are!” muttered the young autocrat to his
courtiers, a little piqued, perhaps, at their rejoinder. Yet, if such
were really the object of their superstitious dread, the promise they
made was not without its own grim cogency. “If we fulfil not our
engagement,” they said, “may the sky falling upon us crush us, may the
earth opening swallow us, may the sea overflowing its borders drown us.”

With Alexander they kept their pledge, but in 280 B.C., when another
king ruled Macedonia, they over-ran his territories, slew him in battle,
and pillaged the temple of Delphi itself—an act of vandalism so shocking
to the Greeks that it roused their patriotism to such a pitch that they
were able to repulse the enemy in the neighbouring gorges.

Thus compelled to evacuate Greece, the Celts invaded Asia Minor in 278
B.C., and established there the well-known colony of Galatia. It was to
their descendants that St. Paul addressed his trenchant epistle, and the
words, “O foolish Galatians, who hath druided you?”

For six centuries after they continued to speak their language there, so
that St. Paul must have heard one dialect at least of the ancient
tongue.

It may surprise students of the classics to learn that the Celts claim
Hercules as one of their own potentates. In an old Gaelic MS. in the
Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, we find the renowned hero figuring thus:
“Ercoill mac Amphitrionis, mhic Antestis, mhic Andlis, mhic Mitonis,
mhic Festime, mhic Athol, mhic Gregais, mhic Gomer, mhic Jafed, mhic
Noe”—a truly wonderful genealogy, tracing him up to Noah through the
Cymric Gomer.

The Greek version of the myth is interesting. It tells how Hercules, on
his expedition against Geryon, turned aside into Gaul and married there
a handsome Gaulish lady, by whom he had a son, Galates. This Galates,
surpassing all his countrymen in strength and prowess, led the way to
conquest, and exercising a wide sway, his territory and subjects
eventually came to be named after him—the one Galatia, the other Galatæ.

In whatever way the classic story originated, it is matter of history
that after the Celtic invasion of Greece, Galatæ became the popular
Greek name for the people hitherto known as κελτοι, even as Galli was
the favourite Roman one.

But already, before the Greek repulse, the Celtic cup of conquest was
full, and their vast empire began to crumble and disintegrate. The first
great shock was given by the revolt of their born thralls, the Germans,
about 300 B.C. In the struggle for independence these recovered their
liberty and big stretches of territory. Besides falling out with the
Greeks, the flurried tribes in that wild consternation of defeat came to
blows with the Romans also, who in two different battles got the victory
over them. Forced to ally themselves with former foes, now with the
Etruscans, again with the Carthaginians, the Celts still fought
desperately, but all in vain. Their dominion was doomed. And as if to
hasten the swift debacle, the various sections of the same great people
attacked and dispossessed each other. It was probably in the pressure of
those times that the Brittonic invaders surged into Britain and elbowed
their Gaelic kinsmen into more straitened circumstances; for all the
continental Celts were simultaneously in the throes of a lamentable
dispersion. Reverse followed reverse with singular fatality. Every
attempt to redeem their desperate fortunes seemed to fail. “They went to
the war, but they always fell,” said their own sad bard afterwards,
summing up in one terse antithesis the history of their collapse.

The failure was crushing and irretrievable. They lost Spain, they lost
the north of Italy, they lost Gaul, and subsequently Britain.

The story of Cæsar’s conquests needs no rehearsal. By 80 A.D. all
Britain south of the Firth of Forth figured as a Roman province.

Meantime the Celtic dialects of Gaul and Spain were gradually being
superseded by the Latin, and even the laws, habits, and civil
administration of the people were becoming Roman, until in the third
century of our era scarcely a vestige of the ancient régime remained
outside of the British Isles and Brittany, except to the south of the
latter, where the influence of the discarded dialect on the adopted
Latin might be traced.[5]

In Britain the Romanising process was suddenly arrested by the hasty
departure of the conqueror; and in the helpless abandonment that ensued
the Saxons found an open door. The same fate that they had themselves
formerly inflicted on their kinsmen now overtook the Britons, who were
hustled in great numbers into the wilds of Cornwall, of Wales, and
Strathclyde. And the last stage of the driving west remained to be
accomplished in the case of the Irish, when the Anglo-Celts arrived in
the twelfth century.

Since the great debacle of their race the Celtic remnants have continued
to speak one or other of the dialects bequeathed from their ancestors.
Five of these are living tongues. Apart from the number that speak them
abroad, it is estimated there are upwards of 3,000,000 people in
Brittany and the British Isles whose mother tongue is Celtic. The
distribution and proportion, according to the latest available
statistics,[6] are full of interest, in view of the long struggle for
existence of the language and people, and the extraordinary vitality
they have evinced in defying the tooth of time. These facts may be
crisply tabulated thus:—

 Gaelic.[7]   254,415. Chiefly in the Highlands of Scotland.
 Irish.       679,145. West of a line in Ireland from Dungarvon Bay to
                         Loch Swilly.
 Manx.          3,000. West Coast, Isle of Man.
 Welsh.       900,000. Over Wales.
 Cornish.     Extinct. Formerly Cornwall.
 Breton.    1,300,000. In Brittany, N.W. corner of France.

A sadly dwindling minority are these fag-ends of once so mighty a race.
There can be no doubt that we see the isolated parts gradually expiring
on the horizon, and with more accelerated speed within the last few
decades than for centuries before. Modern industrialism now woos them
away from the strongholds of their own characteristic life, and the
separate units get absorbed in the common national life and the common
civilisation. Numbers of them—of the Irish especially—are still seeking
a home, following the hereditary instincts of their ancestors, and
hiving westwards to America, only to lose their distinctive Celtic
existence and to be merged in the larger life of that great nation.

The facts are sufficiently patent, but to show the rapidity with which
the disintegration is going on it may be mentioned that since 1851,
3,925,133 persons have emigrated from Ireland alone—a number larger than
that of all the remaining Celtic-speaking population in Europe. In 1899
the number was 43,760; in 1900, 47,107; in 1901, 39,870, the vast
majority of whom were from the western Irish-speaking provinces; and, as
in the depopulation of the Highlands, it is largely a drain of the best
blood, the land being left in the hands of the old and the feeble.

There are those who still write and dream of laying the foundations of a
new Celtic civilisation, but in view of the present subtle and swift
dissolution it is hard to know what they mean, unless indeed it be a
leavening of the existing civilisation by a recrudescence of the Celtic
spirit and Celtic aspirations.

In the main the race has already become fused with the population of
Europe, disappearing as Gallo-Grecians in the east, as Celt-Iberians in
Spain, as Gallo-Franks and Anglo-Celts in the north-west—all but the
Celtic fringes that are shedding their past.

Thus far the history, and from what we have said it will appear that the
Celts first emerge in literature in the fifth century B.C., from which
time the classical writers make frequent, though generally short and
meagre allusions to them. Dr. W. Z. Ripley,[8] one of the latest
authorities on ethnology, would discount their evidence as of little
value for the purposes of modern scientific research into race origins
and affinities, yet, nevertheless, so far as it goes, it is highly
interesting and important.

The earliest of all the Greek authors to mention the Celts, if we except
the geographer Hecatæus (520 B.C.), is Herodotus (484–425?), who twice
refers to them in his history as dwelling at the sources of the Danube
and bordering on the Kunesii, the westermost inhabitants of Europe.
Xenophon, at a later period (390), speaking of them as mercenaries with
Dionysius of Syracuse in 368 B.C., remarks that “the ships brought
Keltoi and Iberes.” Plato, Ephorus, Pytheas, and Scylax all furnish
hints in the same century. Aristotle also knew about this extraordinary
people, who, he was told, feared “neither earthquake nor floods,” living
in a country so cold that even the ass did not thrive there, yet putting
little clothing on their children. It appears he had also heard that
they had sacked Rome. Timæus popularised the new name Galatæ in bringing
into notice Galatia, which, he avers, is named after “Galates, son of
Cyclops and Galatia.”

From this time onward we get fuller details of the Celtic character,
manners, and customs. And to show the number and variety of authorities
from which information may be gleaned, the following may be selected:
Polybius, a Greek writer of the second century B.C., and Posidonius of
the first. Julius Cæsar and his contemporary Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, a
geographer of the early part of the first century A.D., Virgil, Cicero,
Livy, Tacitus, Dion Cassius, Pliny, Ptolemy, and Ammianus Marcellinus,
the latter bringing the list down towards the end of the fourth century,
when the Roman Empire in its own turn began to break up, and the Gaels
were at length prepared to enter the arena of literature and speak for
themselves.

It is outwith the scope of this chapter to go into many of the
interesting details which these various authors furnish, but a few of
those which astonished the writers may be noted in passing, such as, the
Celts’ intellectual cleverness; their numbers and great size; the
magnificence of their funerals, and their belief in the immortality of
the soul. Their cities were forests, and though otherwise cleanly in
their eating, lion-like, they were wont to take up huge joints and gnaw
at them. Other features of striking peculiarity were their figurative,
exaggerated language; the functions of bards and druids; their chariots
and excellent horsemanship; the fierceness and noise of their first
onset in battle; their readiness to be disheartened by reverse; their
astounding clothes,—dyed tunics, flowered with various colours, flaming
and fantastic, striped cloaks buckled on their shoulders, and breeches.
Their chiefs generally appeared with a retinue of followers. Of old, the
Celts devoted themselves to plundering other people’s countries. The
heads of their fallen enemies they cut off and hung to their horses’
manes; they were warlike, passionate, and always ready for fighting;
otherwise simple, frank, hospitable to strangers, but vain, quarrelsome,
fickle, and ever prone to waste their strength on personal feuds and
factions. Such were some of the curious traits and customs of our Celtic
progenitors as seen through Greek and Roman eyes.

Scarcely had the Romans finally abandoned Britain than the Celts enter
upon a new rôle. They annex the Roman script, the Roman language for
literary work, and the Roman art of writing. And thus equipped, they
proceed to produce a literature of their own in Latin and Gaelic. The
wonder is that with their natural quickness and thirst for knowledge
they did not achieve a record in this direction before.

When we reflect on the other great nations of antiquity, we find that
they generally had a literature of some kind, written down, if not in
books, then on skins or slabs and in temples. The Egyptians had their
“Book of the Dead,” the Indians their “Rig-veda,” the Persians their
“Zend-avesta,” the Chinese and Hebrews their “Sacred Books,” the Greeks
and Romans their classics, and we naturally ask, “What had the Celts in
the zenith of their power?” say between 500 and 300 B.C. No writing at
all that we know of. At this day only a few inscriptions remain in the
Gaulish language of Cæsar’s time and later, but nothing earlier. These
nomadic warrior populations may have had their bardic compositions and
tales floating by oral tradition, but we have no evidence that they
developed a literature, though some of them may have known Greek
letters.

It is to the insular Gaels, to those of Ireland and Scotland in the
fifth and sixth centuries of our era, that we have to look for the early
beginnings of Celtic literature. The Irish first showed signs of a rude
awakening to activity in this direction. They invented a system of
writing peculiar to themselves, simple and ingenious, and good enough
for rough inscriptions on stones, but too cumbrous for the needs of
literature.

Their earliest records are to be found in this Ogam script, which
consists of a number of short lines drawn straight or slanting, either
above, below, or through a long stem-line. Thus—

             |     ||     |||     ||||     |||||
             +-----++-----+++-----++++-----+++++----------
             h      d      t      c          qu

represents the letters h, d, t, c, qu, being the first letters of the
first five numerals in Gaelic, h’aon, dha, tri, ceithir, coig; the last
in Manx is queig; in Irish cuig; and in Latin quinque.

The vowels are similarly represented, broad vowels, a, o, u; small
vowels, e, i—

             |     ||     |||     ||||     |||||
             +-----++-----+++-----++++-----+++++----------
             |     ||     |||     ||||     |||||
             a      o      u       e         i

Over two hundred stones have been found inscribed with Ogam writing,
most of them in the south-west of Ireland, from twenty to thirty in
Wales and Devonshire, and ten in Scotland. The Book of Ballymote, a MS.
of the fourteenth century, fortunately contains a key to some of these
inscriptions, so that many of them have been read, though not all.

Who introduced this peculiar mode of writing? and when? are questions
that have never yet been determined. Brash, who made personal inspection
of most of the stones, was of opinion that they are of pre-Christian
origin, whereas Dr. Graves has attempted to prove that they belong to a
period between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D.

References to Ogam inscriptions are frequently met with in the earliest
Celtic literature, and some examined contain grammatical forms alleged
to be older than those of the most ancient MSS., and corresponding even
with the archaic forms of the antique Gaulish monuments.

The Ogam used to be written on wood and stone, and it is not improbable
that many of the genealogies and bits of legendary lore may have been
handed down from generation to generation in this way, as well as by
oral tradition.

It is with the great wave of Christian evangelisation that passed over
Ireland and Scotland successively, through the labours of St. Patrick
and St. Columba, that the use of the Roman script became widely general,
and we trace the dawn of letters. Round the names of these two men there
shines a lustre which the lapse of ages has failed to dim. They not only
kindled the torch of a higher faith and purer life among their Celtic
brethren, but they lighted also the lamp of literature, which has
continued to burn with more or less radiance for 1500 years.

St. Patrick, as the earlier of the two, is really the Cædmon of Gaelic
literature. Born in Scotland, probably, as the later critics think, at
Old Kilpatrick, near Dumbarton, he was, while yet a youth of sixteen,
carried captive to Hiberio, and though he escaped after six years from
his hard fate as his master’s thrall and feeder of cattle, his
missionary zeal, new kindled, urged him to return as evangelist to the
land of his former oppression. The visions of his early captivity, as he
lay down to rest of nights near the cattle, remind us of Cædmon’s vision
in the stable at Whitby, upwards of two hundred years after—a vision
which issued in the birth of English literature, as did those of St
Patrick in that of Gaelic.

And so the unassuming herd emerges as the first known writer of the
ancient Celtic people, the first of whom we have any definite authentic
knowledge.

Three literary compositions stand in his name, namely, his “Confession,”
written in rugged Latin, his “Epistle to Coroticus,” in similar language
and style, and the “Deer’s Cry,” a lorica or prayer in Gaelic. This hymn
has always been regarded, and rightly too, as a gem of sacred song.

The religious and literary dawn that lit up Ireland in the fifth century
reached Scotland in the sixth through the advent of the heroic Columba.
He too, by unhappy circumstances driven over sea, lived an exile in “the
land of his adoption tried,” and with even more brilliance and learning
did for Scotland what St. Patrick did for Ireland. So that the school of
Iona became for centuries after his death a centre of light and leading
in religion and letters, not only for Scotland and Ireland, but also for
many parts of Europe.

His own special contributions to literature include several beautiful
poems in Gaelic and Latin, and many transcripts in Latin of parts of
books of Scripture, such as the Cathrach, a copy of the Psalter believed
to have been made while he was yet a student, and perhaps also the Book
of Durrow and the Book of Kells—two wonderful specimens of penmanship
and early Celtic art. If these latter are not exactly the work of his
own hands they belong at least to the Columban period, an era of great
literary activity, which produced, among other well-known works, the
_Amra Choluimcille_ of Dallan Forgaill, Adamnan’s _Life of Columba_, and
the Book of Deer.

It will thus be seen that the earliest written MSS. of the Celtic people
are essentially a Christian literature, which ignored almost entirely
the pagan traditions of the race in its effort to supersede them. But
the atmosphere was heavy with these, and apparently from pre-Christian
times there had come floating down by oral transmission a great mass of
heroic saga which at length found written expression in the seventh or
eighth century A.D. So that now to the purely Christian literature there
was added the purely pagan, which much more faithfully reflected the
characteristic flavour of the race, its strength, and its weakness, its
facts, its fancies, and its foibles. Professing to go back to a remote
antiquity, it is significant that the setting of this ancient saga is
confined exclusively to these islands. None of the stories belong to
Europe or the doings of the parent stock in its palmy days. As compared
with the Christian, this pagan contribution is by far the more important
from a literary point of view. Yet it must be borne in mind that though
there are still extant in Ireland Celtic Latin MSS. which reach up to
the time of St. Patrick and St. Columba, there is none existing which
contains actual Gaelic writing prior to the eighth century.

Almost the only specimen of continuous prose written by the end of the
eighth century now known to exist is a portion of a Gaelic sermon on
temperance and self-denial from the text, “If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” This
curious relic is in the town library of Cambray, in a MS. containing the
canons of an Irish council held in 684. The MS., however, bears direct
evidence that it was not written until about a century afterwards.

The earliest written Gaelic is contained in MSS. on the Continent, such
as those at Milan, Cambray, Vienna, St. Gall, and other places. And even
these are not books of saga, but generally Latin books with some Gaelic
poems jotted on the leaf margins, or glosses, and other explanatory
writing. There are a few such literary monuments also in the British
Isles, containing ancient Gaelic. The Book of Armagh, for example, dates
from 807, and in addition to vernacular notes, preserves the Latin
“Confessions” of St. Patrick, copied, it is believed, from the apostle’s
own autograph MS. The Book of Deer, almost equally venerable, with a
Gaelic colophon, belongs to the same century. To its original contents
were added in the eleventh and twelfth centuries Gaelic entries which
are of uncommon philological and historical interest and value.

But setting aside these Latin books in which the Gaelic jottings are
purely incidental and secondary, we need to come down as far as the
eleventh century to reach the existing sources of the earliest written
compositions in the native tongue. It is in such MSS. as the Leabhar Na
h’Uidhre, the Book of Hymns, and the other great MiddleAge gleanings of
after days that we find the Patrician and Columban literature as well as
the ancient sagas.

Till within very recent times the Celt had no idea that he was heir to
such a vast literary inheritance as really exists. As in the olden times
men sometimes buried their wealth to save it from the hands of ruthless
foes, and, dying themselves or falling in the fray, lived not to
indicate to others the site of their hid treasures, so it has happened
in the case of Gaelic literature. Much of it perished at the hands of
the enemy and the avenger. What was saved from the wreck of the more
stormy and turbulent periods of our history owes its existence to-day
very largely to concealment and neglect. And as the plough or the spade
occasionally turns up an old stone cist, or a casket of ancient coins,
or a canoe of primitive man, so the casual researches of antiquarians
and scholars have brought to light a hidden mass of ancient writings
which appear to have been scattered broadcast over Europe and the
British Isles. These Gaelic relics are now jealously preserved in
various countries, and within the last century have been made the
subject of the most interested scrutiny by leading Continental and
British philologists, with the result that they have thrown a welcome
light on some of the darker problems of history, philology, and
ethnology. For example, as late as the first quarter of last century few
people had any idea that the Celtic populations were allied with the
southern nations of Europe, or that their language had any connection
whatever with the Romance and Teutonic tongues. One solitary scholar,[9]
indeed, threw out the hint as early as 1786, but offered no proof; and
it remained a visionary hypothesis until the long list of documents
reappearing one by one enabled scholars to establish the point beyond
question, that linguistically the Celtic people are a branch of the
great Aryan family, and thus closely allied with the Teutonic, and still
more nearly with the Greek and the Latin peoples. Roughly, this
relationship may be represented as under. The table is not meant to
indicate race affinities, which it is very far indeed from doing, but
simply to exhibit the affinities of language which modern philological
studies have traced:—

It is this important and surprising discovery, that we are a part of a
vast Indo-European family spread to the east over a great part of Asia,
and to the west over the most of Europe including Russia, that has given
such impetus to Celtic studies within recent years. The Gaelic has been
found to have roots which go far down towards the parent stock. And its
literature, therefore, is of the utmost value to all who seek to read
the riddle of the past and to push back the horizons of knowledge beyond
the age even of Herodotus, “the father of history.”

There is a fascination and refining influence in the study of the Greek
and Roman classics, but for the man of large outlook and broad human
sympathies there is much also to interest and attract in the literature
of the Gael—so old, so weird, so fanciful.

Wordsworth, as he listened to the song of the Highland maid in the
harvest field, felt the pathos of the past in that moving Gaelic
product, and would fain learn its story. Hence his reverie—

                  Will no one tell me what she sings?
                  Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
                  For old unhappy far-off things,
                  And battles long ago.

That is just what they do; dealing with much brighter things too. For
the spirit of the race is enshrined in these old writings, and the
fortunes of the race in their history.

In the census of 1901 the schedule restricts the entries in the Gaelic
column to persons over three years of age. According to the previous
census the number of persons under three years of age amounted to 7½ per
cent of the whole population. This must be taken into account in order
to institute a fair comparison between the returns of the
Gaelic-speaking population in 1891 and 1901.




                               CHAPTER II
               ST. PATRICK, THE PIONEER OF CELTIC WRITERS

  The historical Patrick—Authentic records—Earliest known Gaelic
      litterateur—Dates elusive—Birthplace—Autobiographical details of
      his youth—Taken captive—Escape—Obscure wanderings—Return
      home—The rôle of missionary in Ireland—Epoch-making
      career—Remarkable Patrician Dialogues—His own literary work—The
      “Confession”—“Epistle to Coroticus”—“Deer’s Cry”—Ireland’s
      oldest book—Three other antique compositions from the Book of
      Hymns—A curious prophecy—Personal character—Death.


It is a characteristic of our age to doubt, if not to deny, the
historical reality of many of the heroic figures that hover in the
background of history. And such a doubt has extended even to St.
Patrick, due largely to the fact that he is not mentioned by the early
historians Prosper of Aquitaine (402–463) and Bede (673–735), both of
whom attribute the conversion of Ireland to Palladius.

But this seeming omission has been explained on the highly probable
assumption that Patrick[10] was the Palladius of these writers; and
against the merely negative inference there is the positive and almost
overwhelming voice of history and tradition, which puts the essential
features of Ireland’s apostle beyond all doubt.

The authentic records of his career are numerous and very old, dating
back, we may say, to his own handwriting. For in the Book of Armagh we
have what professes to be a copy of the autobiographical “Confession”
which he wrote himself late in life. This Book of Armagh, one of the
most ancient and exquisite of the Irish MSS., is itself nearly 1100
years old, having been written in 807 by a scribe Ferdomnach, and, in
addition to the “Confession” and other interesting contents, it has
preserved to us various Patrician documents. That the writer had before
him the actual autograph MS. of the saint when copying the “Confession”
is inferred from his own words, “Thus far the volume which Patrick wrote
with his own hand. On the seventeenth day of March was Patrick
translated to the heavens.” And also from his frequent marks of
interrogation and casual hints, such as, “The Book is uncertain here,”
showing that during the intervening centuries since Patrick wrote the
writing must have become faded and even illegible in some places.

Besides his own personal account, there is no lack of early lives by
other authors. Among those that may still be consulted are: (1) the
biographical Hymn by Fiacc of Sletty, one of the saint’s own
contemporaries; (2) two seventh-century Lives known as Tirechan’s and
Muirchu Mac Cumachteni’s, found in the Book of Armagh; (3) the
Tripartite Life, largest of all, from three very ancient Gaelic MSS.,
believed by Colgan, though not by later critics, to belong to the early
part of the sixth century, and translated by him in his _Trias
Thaumaturga_, 1645; (4) the Monk Jocelin’s memoir, twelfth century; and
(5) other MSS. of the eleventh and fifteenth centuries. Subsequent
authors, of course, are mainly dependent on these.

A great historic character was this St. Patrick, who could not be buried
in documents. His own words have far-reaching significance, beyond even
what he himself meant to convey when he wrote, “He who is mighty came
and in his mercy supported me, and raised me up and placed me on the top
of a wall.” On this eminence St. Patrick is great, not merely as apostle
of Ireland, but also as occupying a niche in the origins of Celtic
literature. Essentially a man of religious initiative, and making no
claim to distinction as a writer, he is nevertheless the earliest known
pioneer of letters in Ireland—the first of whose work we have definite
records to attest the authenticity.

What share he had in making the latter a literary country it is
difficult to say; but from his missionary advent in Ireland a knowledge
of letters seems to have spread rapidly over the land. His monasteries
and churches were centres and nurseries of learning. “He used,” as
Tirechan tells us, “to baptize men daily and to read letters and
abgatoriae with them.”

There is a high probability that the Ogam writing peculiar to Ireland
originated before his time, and even the beautiful modification of the
Roman alphabet found in Irish books. These are still matters for
research. But one thing, at least, is claimed for the saint and his
Christian followers, that they made the use of the Roman script for the
first time widely general. And this had far-reaching results for the
future, since only by its adaptation, as apart from the rude and
cumbrous though ingeniously simple Ogam, was any real literature
possible.

In view of the mass of biographical material that has collected round
the venerated name of St Patrick, it might be supposed that every event
of his life would stand out clear and luminous. Yet such is the
perversity of historic authorship, that names and dates and even
oft-told incidents are hard to get at in their true setting. The career
of the apostle is inextricably jumbled up and confused with that of two
others—the traditional Palladius and another Patrick, both of which
semi-mythical characters appear and disappear again and again, crossing
his path like his double; insomuch that it has been conjectured that the
incidents of one life are often transferred to another, and the saint is
credited with experiences which really belonged to the history of the
other two, such, for example, as his alleged mandate from the Pope and
the superior continental training under Germanus.

Dates especially are wonderfully elusive. The usual chronology for St.
Patrick’s career is given as follows: Birth, 387; missionary advent in
Ireland, 432; death, 492 or 493. Yet each of these dates is still under
discussion. Dr. Whitley Stokes puts the advent as early as 397; Dr. Todd
as late as 439 or 440. And so, after all that has been said and
searched, we are dependent for the essential features and outstanding
facts of his life upon the apostle’s own writings.

Such historical details as are generally accepted may be briefly given.
But in this case there is an advantage in quoting the _ipsissima verba_
of the saint, and thus allow him to tell his own tale at critical points
of his career, for his style and matter are themselves a revelation of
character.

He first projects himself on the canvas of literary history by relating
early circumstances and the pregnant event which changed the whole
aspect of his life, and gave it the direction it afterwards took. Thus
he begins:—

  I, Patrick, a sinner, the rudest and least of all the faithful and the
  most despicable among most men, had for my father Calpornius a deacon,
  son of the late Potitus a presbyter, who was of the town of Bonaven
  Taberniæ; for he had a farm in the neighbourhood where I was taken
  captive. I was then sixteen years old. I knew not the true God, and I
  was carried in captivity to Hiberio with many thousands of men
  according to our deserts, because we had gone back from God and had
  not kept His commandments, and were not obedient to our priests who
  used to warn us for our salvation.

Bonaven Taberniæ has been the subject of much eager inquiry to this day.
Where is it? or Nemthur, the alternative name furnished by Fiacc of
Sletty? Many places claim the honour of being the birthplace of the
saint. Boulogne, Bristol, Glastonbury, Carlisle, Tours, Caerleon, and
Ireland have all contended at one time or another for the prestige. But
the best authorities in recent times seem to favour Old Kilpatrick, near
Dumbarton, as the most likely locality from which sprung the saint, and
as fulfilling better than any of the others the actual suggestions of
the records. In the river opposite the town there is a rock visible at
low water, called St. Patrick’s stone, tradition alleging that the ship
in which he sailed away to Ireland struck against it, but continued its
voyage unharmed.

In captivity in Antrim he remained for six years, his daily employment
being to feed cattle. Then the love of God entered his heart, he tells
us, and a spirit of prayer grew upon him. Often he would say a hundred
prayers in a day, and rise of nights to resort to the woods and
mountains in snow, and frost, and rain, for the same purpose.

While thus exercised, one night, in a dream, a voice came to him saying,
“Thy fasting is well; thou shalt soon return to thy country.” Later on,
the dream was repeated, the same voice assuring him that the ship was
now ready, 200 miles away.

Waiting no longer, the poor enthused slave fled from his master, and,
after long wandering, reached the port, where he found indeed a ship,
but the captain of it proved rough and hostile, and refused to have
anything to do with him. On the way back to his hut he was recalled by a
sailor, the upshot of the parley being that he accompanied the crew on
the voyage. Afterwards he seems to have been detained by them on shore,
perhaps in Gaul, as they wandered in a desert and suffered great
hardships. “How is it, Christian?” said the captain one day when no food
could be had. Patrick gave a characteristic reply, and he tells us that
they were saved from starvation on that occasion by a herd of swine soon
after appearing, some of which they killed and ate.

There is no mention in his account of any Continental sojourn,[11]
though almost all the Lives make reference to such. Fiacc of Sletty
waxes poetical over it:—

 He went across all the Alps—great God, it was a marvel of a journey—
 Until he staid with German in the south, in the south part of Latium;
 In the isles of the Tyrrhene Sea he remained, therein he meditated,
 He read the Canon with German; it is this that writings declare
 To Ireland God’s angels were bringing him in his course,
 Often was it seen in vision that he would come thither again.

If such wandering took place, it was probably after he escaped from the
mariners. For, over twenty-two years of his life at this period seem to
be a blank, unless accounted for by some such sojourn in this country or
abroad. At length, after great privations and lonely struggle, he made
his way back to his parents, who received him “as a son, and earnestly
besought him not to expose himself to fresh dangers, but to remain with
them henceforth.”

For a while he did stay, and then the apostolic spirit came upon him.
“In the dead of night,” he says, “I saw a man coming to me as if from
Hiberio, whose name was Victoricus, having innumerable epistles. And he
gave me one of them, and I read the beginning of it, which contained the
words, ‘The voice of the Irish.’ And whilst I was repeating the
beginning of the epistle, I imagined that I heard in my mind the voice
of those who were near the wood of Foclut, which is near the Western
Sea, and then they cried, ‘We pray thee, holy youth, to come and
henceforth walk amongst us.’”

He is supposed to have been forty-five years of age then. His mission,
we see, he attributed solely to an inward call or divine command. There
is no mention of any authority from the Pope, of any visit to Rome or
Gaul, or even of the superior education he is credited with having
received on the Continent under Germanus. On the contrary, he speaks of
himself in his early condition as “a rustic, a fugitive, unlearned, and
not knowing how to provide for the coming day;” spiritually, “like a
stone lying in the deep mud.” And in later life, in reference to the
“Confession,” “Wherefore I thought of writing long ago, but hesitated
till now, for I feared I should not fall into the language of men;
because I have not read like others who have been taught sacred letters
in the best manner, and have never changed their language from infancy,
but were always adding to its perfection; for my language and speech is
translated into a foreign tongue. Indeed, it can be easily perceived
from the childishness of my writing after what manner I have been
instructed and taught.”

He had used Latin, no doubt, as his mother tongue in boyhood, but, not
having received much instruction in it, he had never cultivated it as a
literary language, and consequently it had, during his captivity, fallen
very much into abeyance, so that it was difficult for him in later days
to write this language of the learned as fluently as he would wish.

His father was of Roman descent. His mother is said to have been
British—a merely conjectural statement.

Like St. Columba in after years, St. Patrick addressed the tribesmen
through their chiefs and kings, and was tolerant of contemporary
superstitions, seeking rather to graft the new faith upon the old. He
adopted the pagan festivals and associated them with Christian events.
At Tara, however, he attacked paganism in its stronghold and burnt the
druidical books, extorting from King Laoghaire a reluctant acquiescence
in his work. From the chief, Daire, he obtained the site for his famous
monastery at Armagh, which became his headquarters. He threw down, in
what is the present county of Cavan, the great idol Crom Cruach—object
of immemorial veneration and savage rites. From the huge stone, which
bowed westward on that day of doom, the demon is reported to have fled
to hell, leaving his fallen image leaning over, so that what was once
called “The Chief of the Mound” was henceforth known as “The Crooked one
[Crom Cruach] of the Mound.”

As his work advanced, a vast following of missionaries, bishops, and
even chiefs and sub-kings, with their subjects, came under his
influence. He had a share also in reforming the ancient druidical laws
of Ireland, and bringing them more into harmony with Christian
principles. According to the “Four Masters,” it was in 438 the part of
the Brehon Law known as the Seanchus Mor, and still preserved in
venerable documents, was redacted. Much of the work may be of later
dates, but tradition credits St. Patrick with having undertaken the task
along with others, and with having effected a drastic purification in
his own lifetime.

Many legends have gathered round his name during the ages, and
superstitious beliefs, as one might expect. Yet, so great is his
prestige in the land of his adoption to this day, that not only are
thousands called by his name, but the peasantry of Ireland actually
believe that St. Patrick banished snakes from the island.

The historical records know nothing of any meeting between Ossian and
the saint; yet in some of the older MSS. there are Dialogues[12] in the
heroic style reported as having been carried on between them, the bard
representing the pagan ideal of his ancestors, the saint the Christian
ideal of the Church. They are evidently the work of later times, some
centuries, no doubt, after the saint’s time. But, both from a literary
and religious point of view, they are profoundly interesting.

Besides these characteristic Dialogues reported in the Book of Lismore
and other ancient MSS., and assumed to have taken place between St.
Patrick and Ossian, there is a romantic and beautiful one recorded by
Tirechan, and repeated with more or less variations in the Lives of St.
Patrick, and consequently of great antiquity. It is taken from the Book
of Armagh.

The saint had come to the well called Clebach, and before sunrise sat
down beside it with his followers.

  And lo! the two daughters of King Laoghaire, Ethne the fair and Fedelm
  the ruddy, came early to the well to wash after the manner of women,
  and they found near the well a synod of holy Bishops with Patrick. And
  they knew not whence they were or in what form or from what people, or
  from what country; but they supposed them to be divine sidhe, or gods
  of the earth, or a phantasm, and the virgins said unto them, “Who are
  ye! and whence come ye?” And Patrick said unto them, “It were better
  for you to confess to our true God, than to inquire concerning our
  race.”

        The first virgin said,
        “Who is God?
        And where is God?
        And of what (nature) is God?
        And where is His dwelling-place?
        Has your God sons and daughters, gold and silver?
        Is He ever living?
        Is He beautiful?
        Did Mary foster His Son?
        Are His daughters dear and beautiful to men of the world?
        Is He in heaven or in earth?
        In the sea?
        In rivers?
        In mountainous places?
        In valleys?
        Declare unto us a knowledge of Him,
        How shall He be seen?
        How is He to be loved?
        How is He to be found?
        Is it in youth?
        Is it in old age that He is to be found?”

With swift strides the narrative goes on to tell how the saint
enlightened the two maidens, how they believed and were baptized, how
they received the eucharist of God and slept in death. Thereafter they
were laid on the same bed, covered with garments, while their friends
raised great lamentation for them.

Such is a summary of the chief events in St. Patrick’s long and
epoch-making career in Ireland, taken generally to have lasted sixty
years, so that he must have lived to a ripe old age, if the records
report with any exactness.

Leaving now the biographical and coming to the purely literary aspect of
his life, we find that there are three pieces of literature assigned to
him, namely, the “Confession” and the “Epistle to Coroticus,” both in
Latin, and the “Deer’s Cry” in Gaelic. The two former are sometimes
styled his epistles, numbered I. and II., the history of whose
preservation to our own time is not without its peculiar interest.

Besides the copy of the “Confession” in the Book of Armagh, there are
four other MSS. in existence: (1) the Cottonian, in the British Museum;
(2) two MSS. in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, formerly preserved in the
Salisbury Cathedral; (3) one MS. in the Public Library of Arras. The
text of the Bollandist Fathers was taken from the Arras MS. and
published at Antwerp in 1668 in their _Acta Sanctorum_. A copy of the
“Epistle to Coroticus” accompanies each of the above except that in the
Book of Armagh.

Of the “Confession,” the style and gist may be gathered from the
extracts given as we recounted his life. It is perhaps the earliest
piece of authentic Celtic literature we have, inasmuch as it is the
first of which the authorship can be definitely and historically
asserted. Its Latin is rude and archaic, answering to the description
St. Patrick gives of his own writing. It quotes from the pre-Vulgate
version of the Scriptures, and contains nothing inconsistent with the
period in which it professes to have been written.

The saint appears to have penned this document as a kind of defence of
his apostolic work against the attacks of men who regarded the whole
undertaking as arrogant and presumptuous in view of his own rusticity.
“The rustic condition was created by the Most High,” he gently reminds
them, and adds some plain truths which show that, like Jesus, and St.
Paul, and St Francis of Assisi, and other great master-spirits of the
Christian Evangel, he did not disdain poverty, but voluntarily assumed
it for the promotion of the Gospel. It would be tedious, he says, to
relate even a portion of the many toils and dangers he had gone through.
Twelve times his life was in imminent peril. Never one farthing did he
receive for all his preaching and teaching. He challenges his detractors
to say if he did and it will be returned. The people, indeed, were
generous and offered innumerable gifts, which, out of principle, he
refused, lest it might furnish an opportunity for cavil against the
disinterestedness of his mission. On one occasion, on being told that
his own nephew declared that his preaching would be perfect if he
insisted a little more on the necessity of giving, he gave the noble
reply, that “for the sake of charity he forebore to preach charity.”

The “Epistle to Coroticus” is evidently from the same pen. The Latin and
the literary style are similar. It also quotes from the pre-Vulgate
version, and there is no internal evidence against the assumption that
it was written by the saint. Though not found in the Book of Armagh, it
is preserved in the other MSS. cited, some of which may be as old as the
eleventh and twelfth centuries.

Certain authorities identify Coroticus with the Welsh prince Caredig.
Other more recent scholars, such as Drs. Skene, Whitley Stokes, and
Douglas Hyde, contend that he was a prince of Strathclyde, Ceretic by
name, who had his capital at Alclwyd, the modern Dumbarton, and thus
that he hailed from St. Patrick’s own district.

At any rate, the soldiers and allies of this nominally Christian king
suddenly made a descent on the eastern shores of Ireland, which they
harried, carrying away many of St. Patrick’s converts to be sold as
slaves, and ruthlessly killing numbers of them on the very day after
their baptism, while the symbol of their faith, as he says, was still
wet upon their foreheads, and these neophytes were yet clad in their
white vestments. The letter was sent as a remonstrance against such
barbarous conduct, and to urge the lawless prince to restore the
captives. But to little effect, for the invader treated messengers and
letters alike with ridicule and contempt, delivering the converts
abducted into the hands of the Picts and Scots.

In this letter, as in the “Confession,” St. Patrick gives interesting
personal details. A few extracts are worth quoting. For example:—

  I, Patrick, an unlearned sinner do truly acknowledge that I have been
  constituted a bishop in Ireland. I accept it of God that I am. I dwell
  among barbarians a proselyte and an exile for the love of God.

  I have written these words to be given and delivered to the soldiers
  and by them to Coroticus.... I do not say to my fellow-citizens nor to
  fellow-citizens of pious Romans, but to fellow-citizens of demons,
  through their evil deeds.... I was of noble birth according to the
  flesh, my father being a Decurio. For I bartered my nobility—I do not
  blush nor regret it—for the benefit of others. No thanks to me. But
  God hath put in my heart the anxious desire that I should be one of
  the hunters or fishers who as God formerly announced should appear in
  the last days.... What shall I do, Lord? I am greatly despised. Lo thy
  sheep are torn to pieces around me and plundered by these aforesaid
  marauders under the command of Coroticus.

In this letter he mentions also that he is constrained by the Spirit not
to see any of his kindred.

For St. Patrick’s beautiful hymn, the “Deer’s Cry,” we are indebted to
the Book of Hymns of the eleventh century, which, like the Book of
Armagh, contains several Patrician pieces. It is a Gaelic composition
alleged to have been made by the saint while on his way to the great
Court of Tara. It was celebrated for generations before the English
conquest as a _lorica_ or prayer for protection. Dr. Todd says, “That
this hymn is a composition of great antiquity cannot be questioned. It
is written in a very ancient dialect of the Irish Celtic. It was
evidently composed during the existence of pagan usages in the country.
It makes no allusion to Arianism or any of the heresies prevalent in the
Continental Church. It notices no doctrine or practice of the Church
that is not known to have existed before the fifth century. In its style
and diction, although written in a different language, there is nothing
very dissimilar to the Confession and the letter about Coroticus, and
nothing absolutely inconsistent with the opinion that it may be by the
same author.” Beyond this no positive proof can be given.

In the _Liber Hymnorum_ it is prefaced by the following distinctive
account in Gaelic:—

  Patrick made this hymn. In the time of Laoghaire son of Nial it was
  made. The cause of making it however was to protect himself with his
  monks against the deadly enemies who were in ambush against the
  clerics. And this is a corselet of faith for the protection of body
  and soul against demons and human beings and vices. Every one who
  shall say it every day with pious meditation on God, demons shall not
  stay before him. It will be a safeguard to him against every poison
  and envy; it will be a comna to him against sudden death; it will be a
  corselet to his soul after dying. Patrick sung this when the
  ambuscades were sent against him by Laoghaire that he might not go to
  Tara to sow the faith, so that there seemed before the ambuscaders to
  be wild deer and a fawn after them, to wit, Benen;[13] and faed fiada
  (guard’s cry) is its name.

Apparently the assassins mistook the chanting of the lorica for the cry
of the deer. This saved the party, and furnished a name for the hymn.

A very remarkable and striking piece of literature it is, and one that
does credit to the language in which it is clothed. “For its glow of
imagination and fervour of devotion,” says Dr. Dowden, the author of the
_Early Celtic Church in Scotland_, “it will always challenge a high
place in the history of Christian hymnology.”

It it well worth transcribing also as exhibiting the saint’s creed, his
belief in contemporary superstitions and attitude towards them, his
piety and poetic gift. In all probability we have here a very fair
representation of the gist of his teaching. Like the authors of the
Vedic hymns, and the votaries of all primitive religions, he invokes the
powers of nature, a phase of the religious spirit which seems to have
fallen devotionally in abeyance in modern times. What strikes our age
perhaps as more curious and superstitious, he prays for protection
against the spells of women, smiths, and Druids, like any good heathen.

 I[14] bind myself to-day to a strong virtue, an invocation of (the)
    Trinity. I believe in a Threeness with confession of an Oneness in
    (the) Creator of (the) Universe.
 I bind myself to-day to the virtue of Christ’s birth with his baptism,
   To the virtue of his crucifixion with his burial,
   To the virtue of his resurrection with his ascension,
   To the virtue of his coming to the Judgment of Doom.
 I bind myself to-day to the virtue of ranks of Cherubim,
   In obedience of angels,
   (In service of archangels),
   In hope of resurrection for reward,
   In prayers of patriarchs,
   In predictions of prophets,
   In preachings of apostles,
   In faiths of confessors,
   In innocence of holy virgins,
   In deeds of righteous men.
 I bind myself to-day to the virtue of Heaven,
   In light of sun,
   In brightness of snow,
   In splendour of fire,
   In speed of lightning,
   In swiftness of wind,
   In depth of sea,
   In stability of earth,
   In compactness of rock.
 I bind myself to-day to God’s virtue to pilot me,
   God’s might to uphold me,
   God’s wisdom to guide me,
   God’s eye to look before me,
   God’s ear to hear me,
   God’s word to speak for me,
   God’s hand to guard me,
   God’s way to lie before me,
   God’s shield to protect me,
   God’s host to secure me,
     Against snares of demons,
     Against seductions of vices,
     Against lusts (?) of nature,
     Against every one who wishes ill to me,
     Afar and anear,
     Alone and in a multitude,
 So have I invoked all these virtues between me (and these)
   Against every cruel, merciless power which may come, against my body
      and my soul,
   Against incantations of false prophets.
   Against black laws of heathenry,
   Against false laws of heretics,
   Against craft of idolatry,
   Against spells of women, and smiths, and Druids,
   Against every knowledge that defiles men’s souls,
     Christ to protect me to-day.
   Against poison, against burning, against drowning, against death
      wound,
     Until a multitude of rewards come to me!
 Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ in me!
 Christ below me, Christ above me, Christ at my right, Christ at my left,
 Christ in breadth, Christ in length, Christ in height!
 Christ in the heart of every one who thinks of me,
 Christ in the mouth of every one who speaks to me,
 Christ in every eye who sees me,
 Christ in every ear who hears me.
 I bind myself to-day to a strong virtue, an invocation of (the) Trinity,
 I believe in a Threeness with confession of an Oneness in (the) Creator
    of (the) Universe
 Domini est salus, Domini est salus, Christi est salus,
 Salus tua Domine, sit semper nobiscum.

The oldest book in Ireland is now believed to be the _Domhnach Airgid_,
a copy of the four Gospels in Latin presented, according to the
“Tripartite Life,” by St. Patrick to St. Aedh Maccarthenn of Clogher.
For protection it has a triple shrine of yew, silver-plated copper, and
gold-plated silver. Shrine and MS. are to-day among the most prized
treasures of the Royal Irish Academy. It is highly probable, says
Professor G. T. Stokes and Dr. Wright, that it was the veritable copy
used by St. Patrick himself.

The Book of Hymns has also three other very interesting compositions,
which profess to date back to his time.

First there is Sechnall’s Hymn in praise of St. Patrick, supposed to
have been written during his lifetime, and generally regarded as
genuine. St. Sechnall, or Secundius as he is sometimes called, was the
nephew and disciple of Patrick, and associated with him in the See of
Armagh, either as contemporaneous bishop or as his successor. It was he
who annoyed the saint by his sordid remark about preaching on the
necessity of giving. To condone for the pain he gave his uncle, the
penitent Sechnall composed this poem of twenty-two stanzas in his
praise, thus constituting himself, if written before the “Deer’s Cry,”
the first known poet of Christian Ireland. In view of its alleged
acceptance by St. Patrick, the hymn has been held in great veneration,
and sung as one of his honours on the days of his Festival.

A second Patrician piece in the Book of Hymns is Fiacc of Sletty’s
metrical life—also called a Hymn. It is purely biographical, and written
after St. Patrick’s death, according to the introduction in the above
ancient MS. Here we are told in Gaelic, with Latin words curiously
interpolated, that Patrick said to Dubthach, chief bard of Ireland,
“‘Seek for me a man of rank, of good race, well-moralled, one wife and
one child with him only.’ ‘Why dost thou seek that, to wit a man of that
kind?’ said Dubthach. ‘For him to go into orders,’ said Patrick. ‘Fiacc
is that,’ said Dubthach, ‘and he has gone on a circuit in Connaught.’
Now while they were talking, it is then came Fiacc from his circuit.
‘There,’ said Dubthach, ‘is he of whom we spake.’ ‘Though he be,’ said
Patrick, ‘yet what we say may not be pleasing to him.’ ‘Let a trial be
made to tonsure me,’ said Dubthach, ‘so that Fiacc may see.’ So when
Fiacc saw he asked, ‘Wherefore is the trial made?’ ‘To tonsure
Dubthach,’ say they. ‘That is idle,’ said he, ‘for there is not in
Ireland a poet his equal.’ ‘Thou wouldst be taken in his place,’ said
Patrick. ‘My loss to Ireland,’ says Fiacc, ‘is less than Dubthach’s
(would be).’ So Patrick shore his beard from Fiacc then, and great glee
came upon him thereafter, so that he read all the ecclesiastical ordo in
one night—or fifteen days, as some say—and so that a bishop’s rank was
conferred on him, and so that it is he who is Archbishop of Leinster
thenceforward and his successor after him.”

Dr. Todd thinks it impossible to attribute so high an antiquity to the
Hymn as Fiacc’s own time, since it contains an allusion to the
desolation of Tara. Colgan 250 years previously met the difficulty by
regarding the latter reference as prophetic.

We must not omit a very curious prophecy regarding St. Patrick which the
Scholiast on Fiacc’s Hymn has preserved. It is in the copy of the Book
of Hymns now in the convent of St. Isidore at Rome, a MS. of the
eleventh or twelfth century. From internal evidence it may be recognised
that the stanza cannot be older than the beginning of the seventh
century, but it is written in a very ancient dialect of the Gaelic, and
purported to be an old-time prediction by a pagan Druid.

                       Ticfa tailcend
                       Tar muir murcend,
                       A brat tollcend,
                       A crand chromcend,
                       A mias in iarthur a thigi,
                       Frisgerad a muinter uili
                           Amen, Amen.

 He comes, he comes, with shaven crown, from off the storm-toss’d sea,
 His garment pierced at the neck, with crook-like staff comes he,
 Far in his house, at its east end, his cups and patens lie,
 His people answer to his voice. Amen, Amen, they cry.
                                     Amen, Amen.

A third Patrician fragment in the Book of Hymns, eleventh century, is
entitled Ninine’s Prayer, with the explanatory head-line, “Ninine the
poet made this prayer, or Fiacc of Sletty.” It runs:—

 We put trust in St. Patrick, chief apostle of Ireland,
 Conspicuous his name, wonderful; a flame that baptized Gentiles,
 He fought against hard-hearted Druids; he thrust down proud men with the
    aid of Our Lord of fair heavens.

 He purified the great offspring of meadow-landed Erin,
 We pray to Patrick, chief apostle, who will save us at the Judgment from
    doom to the malevolences of dark demons.
 God be with me with the prayer of Patrick, chief apostle!

In all this varied literature, reaching from his own time till ours, the
Apostle of Ireland stands forth a commanding personality, as different
from St. Columba as St. Francis was from St. Bernard. Genial, earnest,
humble, sensitively sympathetic, with commanding force of character and
irresistible determination as the agent of a Divine Mission, his
enthusiasm made way for him. Less impulsive, less warlike, and less
learned than Columcille, he carried on his spiritual campaign in a
spirit of self-denying devotion and love of men. “Patrick, without
loftiness or arrogance,” as Fiacc describes him, “it was much of good he
thought.” At the end of the day we find him in poverty and misery
writing his Confession, not sure but the morrow of his life may bring a
violent death, or slavery, or some other dread evil.

Yet true to the last in his unquenchable zeal, his own words seem to sum
up the high aim of his life: “Therefore it is very fitting that we
should spread our nets that a copious multitude and crowd may be taken
for God, and that everywhere there may be clergy who shall baptize a
needy and desiring people.”

He died at Saul, while on a visit there from Armagh, and his grave is
believed to be at Downpatrick, to which place tradition says the remains
of St. Columba were transported from Iona in the more troublous times,
and re-interred beside those of his great forerunner.




                              CHAPTER III
            ST. COLUMBA AND THE DAWN OF LETTERS IN SCOTLAND

      influence.


Modern research and historical criticism have done much for Celtic
literature. Not long ago the subject might be regarded as a tangled web
of fact and fiction. Inquirers found it hard to thread their way through
the unsifted mass of materials, to know the true from the fabulous,
authentic history from myth and legend.

All the more because the original documents, like the graves of a
household, were “severed far and wide by mount and stream and sea,” and
for the most part inaccessible. It must be matter of astonishment to
many to learn that very few of our older Celtic MSS.—MSS. written in
these islands—have found a home in Scotland. They have long ago been
transferred to the Continent, to France, Italy, Holland, Switzerland,
Austria, and Germany. So that to-day scores of these venerable relics
are preserved in places as distant and far apart as Milan, St. Gall,
Würzburg, Carlsruhe, Brussels, Turin, Vienna, Berne, Leyden, Nancy,
Paris. Even the oldest MS. now existing that can be proved to have been
written in Scotland, is kept not in Edinburgh or Glasgow, but in the
public library of Schaffhausen in Switzerland.

One reason for this seems to have been that the Irish or Scots gave so
many evangelists and professors in those early days to the Continent,
men like Columbanus and St. Gall, and their followers; and another, when
the books were in danger in the British Isles from the depredations of
the Norsemen, they were removed for security to the monasteries and
seats of learning presided over by these Celtic scholars.

The records thus available, here and there, carry us back over a period
of well nigh 1500 years to the days of St. Patrick and St. Columba. As
Cædmon was the pioneer of English literature, so is St. Patrick the
first known litterateur of Ireland, and St. Columba the first of
Scotland. From the time of the introduction of Christianity by these
men, Celtic literature has a history, continuous and verifiable. Beyond
their day all is uncertain and cloudy. Pagan Scotland lies in the dim
background enveloped in haze. Sagas and myths and poems and romances it
undoubtedly had in abundance, floating by oral tradition, but no written
record. In almost every instance of its old-time lore, authorship is
unknown. That by-past is the region of conjecture, and we can be as
little certain of the origins as Greek scholars are of the genesis of
the _Iliad_ or of the _Odyssey_.

In this study, then, we go back to the march between Pagan and Christian
times, and leaving behind at present the doubtful and uncertain, we
shall endeavour to trace the dawn of letters in Scotland.

On that far horizon the first man we encounter with a pen and a passion
for writing is the wonderful St. Columba. Across the ages his impressive
figure still stands out massive and strong in the background of history.
Among the men of fame—the rarer master-spirits who have helped to make
Scotland what she is—Columcille stands earliest. Vividly and terribly in
earnest himself, he stamped his religious convictions not only upon many
districts of Ireland, but also upon heathen Alba.

He possessed just the qualities that were best fitted to give him an
ascendancy over men in that rude age. Unlike most of the great
evangelists of Christianity, he was of princely origin, descended both
on his father’s and his mother’s side from illustrious Irish kings. This
noble lineage, combined with the patronage of his own kinsman Conall,
King of Dalriada—our modern Argyllshire—gave him an immense influence in
an age when the tribes, even in matters of religion, followed their king
or chief.

But Columcille was personally a born leader of men. Physically and
intellectually he towered above his fellows. Of a tall and commanding
appearance, powerful frame, broad face, close and curly hair, his grey
eyes large and luminous, he looked the saint he was, joyful and radiant,
with a love for everything beautiful in nature, animate and inanimate.
Withal he had a loud and resonant voice, well adapted for impassioned
speech. When preaching, tradition says that he could be easily
understood across the Sound of Mull. And Adamnan assures us that when
singing with his brethren in the church, the venerable man raised his
voice so wonderfully that it was sometimes heard at the distance of 1000
paces, while from the “Old Irish Life” we learn that his reading carried
even farther. A voice to soothe the savage breast with its plaintive
sweetness, and yet of power and range sufficient to awe the pagan mind.

For this apostle of Scotland, despite his name, was no mere cooing dove.
He could be very terrifying when roused. Of a hot and passionate temper,
he was in reality a perfervid Celt; stern and even vindictive at times,
he would fight his battles with the carnal weapons, if need be, just as
readily as he would with the spiritual. Three battles at least, fierce
and sanguinary, stand to his account in history, he their instigator,
two of these even after he became Abbot of Iona.

Altogether a strange character to contemplate was this father and
founder of monasteries, especially when viewed from our scientific
age—the intellectual standpoint of his time was so wholly different from
ours. He continually moved in a halo of miracles, prophecies, and
angels, as real to him as physical laws and nerves and germs are to us.
So credulous was he that he never seemed even to question the magical
impostures of his opponents, the Druids. He is not represented as trying
to expose their marvels, but rather as endeavouring to outrival them by
greater miracles of his own. The one set he believed to be from the evil
one, the other of God. For him the seen always merged in the unseen; the
natural is construed in terms of the supernatural. Science, of course,
had not then formulated laws or facts as we know them, and St. Columba
was a child of his age, imbued with the same credulity as the
contemporary heathen around him, and very much the same superstitions.
He believed he could bless men or blight them by his intercessions, and
sometimes in the exercise of this power he did not even hesitate to
curse irreconcilables and consign them to future destruction.

On one occasion, exasperated with a thief of noble birth who had twice
plundered the house of a man of humble condition, and mocked and laughed
at the rebukes of the saint himself, the irate Columba—and this is a
picture for an artist—followed him to the water’s edge, and wading up to
the knees in the clear green sea-water, raised both his hands to heaven
and solemnly invoked a curse on the man. Returning to the dry ground he
sat down, and forthwith told his companions what the fate of the scamp
would be. No maudlin saint was the imperious Columcille. Gentle,
affectionate, and kind, yet a man to impress the wild Pictish tribes
with awe and reverence.

Born at Gartan, Donegal, in the north of Ireland in 521, and brought up
from youth in Christian principles, he was trained under the best
masters, and apparently caught up in the wave of evangelisation that
swept over Ireland from St. Patrick’s time. At any rate, when
twenty-five years of age he founded the Church of Derry, and seven years
later the Monastery of Durrow. Other establishments soon followed,
springing up here and there under his initiative and fostering care,
until when full forty years old an event occurred which in a manner
changed the whole aspect of his career, and gave a new direction to his
energies. This was the battle of Cooldrevna, of far-reaching import.

Two causes are usually assigned for the fight. St. Finnian of Moville,
under whom the future abbot first studied, brought back with him from
Rome a copy of the Psalms, supposed to be the first copy of St Jerome’s
Vulgate that appeared in Ireland. This the master treasured, and wished
to keep private and reserved. But Columcille, then an ardent student and
rapid writer, sat up for nights together and surreptitiously transcribed
the book for his own use. Hearing of this, Finnian claimed the copy, but
in vain. His disciple refused to part with it, and the matter was
referred to King Diarmad at Tara. This monarch, to whom no doubt a legal
quarrel over a book was new, could find nothing in the Brehon Law to
adjudicate the case by, except the practical adage, _le gach boin a
boinin_ (with every cow her calf), and being perhaps more disposed to
favour Finnian, as of his own kin and jurisdiction, he, not unnaturally,
adapted this precedent to the case in point, giving the judgment, “As
with every cow her calf, so with every book its son.”

This decision is the first we know in the law of copyright. It gave dire
offence to Columba, which was greatly heightened some time after by
another regal affront. It happened at the Great Convention of Tara that
a young prince, in utter violation of the law of sanctuary, slew the son
of the king’s steward, and knowing the penalty to be certain death, fled
for refuge to the northern princes, who placed him under the sheltering
wing of their kinsman, the sacred Columba. Ignoring the saint’s
authority, the king had the refugee promptly seized and put to death.
This, it appears, exasperated the imperious Columcille to the last
degree, and he immediately made his way north, and roused to arms the
race of Hy-Neill, the northern branch against the southern. And with the
King of Connaught, whose son had been slain, they marched their forces
southward. A furious battle ensued at Cooldrevna, in the red ruin and
carnage of which King Diarmad was defeated with the loss of 3000 men.

Two years after, the Hegira took place, when the saint fled or migrated
on his great mission to Scotland—henceforth an exile from Erin.

Speculation has been rife as to the real motive that drove this
intensely patriotic Irishman over the wave. Many would fain believe, in
view of its epoch-making significance, that this momentous step was
purely voluntary “for the love of Christ,” as the “Old Irish Life” puts
it. Adamnan, while connecting it with the battle, also puts this
construction upon it. “In the second year after the battle of
Culdreimhne,” he says, “and in the 42nd year of his age, St. Columba
resolving to emigrate for Christ sailed from Scotia (that is Ireland) to
Britain.” Many other saints had wandered elsewhere on similar missions.
But there is a persistent tradition that this unique missionary was
banished by the Synod of the Saints in Ireland for the bloodshed he had
caused; and that this sentence was confirmed by St. Molaise, whom the
unhappy Columba consulted, and who advised him to seek as many souls in
conversion among the heathen as there fell of men in battle. Some, on
the other hand, construe his action as a voluntary penance,
self-inflicted. Others find mainly a political motive in his removal to
Dalriada, where he might be of immense service to his kinsmen in helping
to avert the ever increasing and harassing incursions of the Picts.
Certainly he became a bulwark to them.

Imbued with a high missionary zeal, there is no doubt that ultimately he
went forth to the new spiritual campaign voluntarily, but, as in the
case of most fateful careers, it is evident that circumstances wound him
up to the task, the most conspicuous and compelling of which was
Cooldrevna. That the parting from Erin was bitter, a very tearing of the
heart, is matter of history. The verses, the records attributed to
himself on this occasion, reveal the depths of his feelings. “How rapid
the speed of my coracle and its stern turned toward Derry. I grieve at
the errand over the proud seas, travelling to Alba of the Ravens. There
is a grey eye that looks back upon Erin, it shall not see during life
the men of Erin nor their wives. My vision over the brine I stretch from
the ample oaken planks; large is the tear from my soft grey eye when I
look back upon Erin. Upon Erin is my attention fixed, upon Loch Leven,
upon Linè, upon the land the Ultonians own; upon smooth Munster, upon
Meath.”

As Dr. Douglas Hyde has sympathetically observed, “Columcille is the
first example in the saddened page of Irish history of the exiled Gael
grieving for his native land and refusing to be comforted, and as such
he has become the very type and embodiment of Irish fate and Irish
character.”

A pity it is that history has not photographed the dramatic scene when
the great monk, forty-two years old, tall and powerful, lands from his
curach the “Liath Bhalaidh,” with twelve followers on the island of Hy,
now the famous Iona. It was in 563 that he took possession of this
future home, of which he had received a grant from the King of Dalriada,
which was afterwards confirmed by King Brude. Modern Scotland had not
yet emerged, being in early fragments. And it is important to note, for
it has been very confusing to historians, that in Columba’s day Ireland
was Scotia, from whence in earlier days the Scots had come, who then
occupied Dalriada, or, as it is known to-day, Argyllshire. North and
east were the Picts, possessing the body of Alba, as modern Scotland was
then called; and in Strathclyde the Britons. Not till centuries after
was the name of Scotia or Scotland finally transferred from Erin to
Alba.

The Dalriadic Scots, though not destitute of a primitive civilisation,
were rude and barbarous. Slavery and polygamy were common, blood feuds
incessant. Women fought side by side with the men in battle, until first
Columba and afterwards Adamnan obtained exemption for them. The heathen
Picts were even more degraded, under the tyranny of a Druid regime, full
of sorcery and superstition. No ray of Christianity seemed as yet to
have penetrated their darkness.

Such were the wild and waste lands into which the devoted Columba threw
himself as a deliverer. For two years he remained in Hy, organising his
base, and, it is thought, learning the Pictish language, before setting
out on his visit to “the powerful king of the Pictish nation.”

His missionary labours for the next thirty-two years, in collaboration
with the devoted band of men who imbibed his spirit and adopted his
methods, have caught the eye of the world.

But there is another aspect of his enterprise, far-reaching and
magnificent, which has been largely overlooked and overshadowed by our
one-sided veneration for his religious genius. And that is the
significance of his literary work. It is not so generally known that the
Apostle of Scotland was a patron of letters, intensely interested in
literature, an ardent writer and disseminator of knowledge—one in fact
who has left his literary mark on the ages, and who was the first to
help to raise Scotland to the proud eminence in education which she
occupies to-day.

As in the great awakening in Europe in the sixteenth century there were
two movements, independent of each other and yet going on side by side—a
revival of religion and a revival of learning, known as the Reformation
and the Renaissance; so, in St. Columba’s enterprise two similar
movements were fostered, not as separate and hostile to each other, but
as mutually helpful and conjoined.

The abbot was from youth a great lover of books and an unwearied scribe.
His standard biographer, Adamnan, says that he never could spend the
space even of one hour without study, or prayer, or writing, or some
other holy occupation, watching or fasting. This love of books continued
in his case to the very end. Not till the day of his demise was the pen
finally laid aside. On that day, after blessing the Monastery, he
descended from the hill and sat in his hut transcribing the Psalter. But
the vitality of that once deft hand and brain was now well-nigh spent,
and answered feebly, like the diminishing flow of water from a spout.
“Here,” cried the saint, at length, conscious of the impending change,
“at the end of the page I must stop, and what follows let Baithene
write.”

It was his love of literature that got him into trouble with St.
Finnian, and in the “Calendar of Aengus” the story goes that he once
visited a man, Longarad, noted for his collection of books. In
anticipation of the visit, and mindful perhaps of Cooldrevna, the _sai_
or saoidh (wise man) hid his treasures, whereupon Columba left “a word,”
that is, a curse, on the books, so that when in after ages they had
become unintelligible from various causes, this was deemed the full and
sufficient reason. “May your books be of no use after you, since you
have exercised inhospitality in withholding them.”

He composed a book of hymns for the office of every day in the week, and
in the “Old Irish Life” he is credited with having written “three
hundred gifted, lasting, illuminated noble books.” It is highly probable
that those thus referred to were simply transcribed by him, for we have
no evidence that he wrote any prose literature.

The three books still existing in Ireland which tradition and some high
authorities regard as the work of his own hand are simply transcripts.
They are certainly very ancient, even if they do not quite reach up to
his day. Two of them are in Trinity College, Dublin, and the third in
the Royal Irish Academy. The former, known as the Book of Durrow and the
Book of Kells,[15] are copies of the Gospels in Latin, the one finished,
the other not, but the Book of Kells, which is the unfinished one,
contains on its blank pages copies of charters of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, connected with the endowment of the Institution. The
other book referred to as in the Royal Irish Academy is the famous
“Cathrach,” believed to be the identical copy of the Psalter that
Columba made when he was a student. The skill displayed in the
penmanship and decoration of these ancient MSS. is astonishing, and they
have covers which are brilliant specimens of early Celtic art. The Book
of Kells, in particular, is spoken of as “the unapproachable glory of
Irish illumination.” In fact, the codex known as the “Four Masters”
alleges that “it was the principal relic of the western world on account
of its remarkable cover.”

Great interest attaches to the celebrated “Cathrach” or “Battler,” so
called from the circumstance that a battle was fought on account of it.
It continued an heirloom in the successive generations of the saint’s
family, the O’Donnells, until a comparatively recent representative,
exiled as a supporter of James II. carried it with him to the Continent
in the beautiful shrine prepared for it at the end of the eleventh
century. In early days it used to be carried three times round the army
when Cinal Conaill went to battle, in the belief that if thus carried on
the breast of a cleric free from mortal sin it would get them the
victory.

In 1802 the precious relic was recovered from the Continent and opened.
Within was found a decayed wooden box covering a mass of vellum stuck
together and hardened into a single lump. By careful moistening
treatment, the various leaves at length came asunder, and proved a real
Psalter, written in Latin in a “neat but hurried hand.” Fifty-eight
leaves remained, containing from the 31st to the 106th Psalm, and an
examination of this text has shown that it is precisely a copy of the
second revision of the Psalter from the Vulgate of St. Jerome, which
strengthens the belief so long and tenaciously held, that this may have
been the very book for which 3000 warriors fell.

From very early times Columba was spoken of as a poet. That he wrote
verse and befriended the bards is attested by the oldest tradition and
some of the most ancient records. Many Gaelic poems are attributed to
him. “Thrice fifty noble lays,” says one poet—

                  Some in Latin which were beguiling,
                  Some in Gaelic, fair the tale.

Among his reputed Gaelic poems may be mentioned three that Colgan
considered genuine, 250 years ago, and were printed by Dr. Reeves in his
first edition of Adamnan’s _Life of St. Columba_: his “Farewell to Ara,”
published in the _Gaelic Miscellany_ of 1808; and another on his escape
from King Diarmad, reproduced in the _Miscellany of the Irish
Archæological Society_. There are three verses composed as a prayer at
the battle of Cooldrevna, ascribed to him in the _Chronicon Scotorum_;
and there is a collection of fifteen poems in the O’Clery MSS. at
Brussels. But by far the largest collection is contained in an oblong
MS. of the Bodleian Library at Oxford. This document embraces everything
in the shape of poem or fragment anywhere believed as his, and that
could be collected about the middle of the sixteenth century.

None of these are found in the oldest MSS., though not a few are
apparently very ancient and beautiful, breathing the intensity of
feeling and passion so characteristic of the Gael. Dr. Hyde is perhaps
not far off the mark when he says that of the great number of Irish
poems attributed to him, only a few—half a dozen at the most—are likely
to be even partly genuine. It is very hard to say how much or how little
is his. But this authority is inclined to agree with Dr. Healy, author
of _Ireland’s Schools and Scholars_, that at least the three considered
genuine by Colgan represent substantially poems that were really written
by the saint. “They breathe his pious spirit,” says Healy, “his ardent
love for nature, and his undying affection for his native land. Although
retouched, perhaps, by a later hand, they savour so strongly of the true
Columban spirit that we are disposed to reckon them amongst the genuine
compositions of the saint.”

A few specimens are worth quoting, by way of illustrating Columba’s
poetic genius:—

  Were the tribute of all Alba mine, from its centre to its border, I
  would prefer the sight of one house in the middle of Derry. The reason
  I love Derry is for its quietness, for its purity and for the crowds
  of white angels from the one end to the other.... My Derry, my little
  oak-grove, my dwelling and my little cell, O eternal God in heaven
  above, woe be to him who violates it.

Ara was a little isle, like Iona, in the west of Ireland, where St. Enda
lived, and was visited by the saints.

  Farewell from me to Ara. It anguishes my heart not to be in the west
  among her waves, amid groups of the saints of heaven. It is far, alas!
  it is far, alas! I have been sent from Ara West out towards the
  population of Mona to visit the Albanachs. Ara Sun, oh Ara Sun, my
  affection lies buried in her in the west, it is the same to be beneath
  her pure soil as to be beneath the soil of Paul and Peter. Ara
  blessed, O Ara blessed, woe to him who is hostile to her, may he be
  given shortness of life and hell.

The next, so characteristic of the saint’s love of nature, is taken from
the poem on Cormac’s visit—one of the three considered genuine:—

  It were delightful, O Son of my God, with a moving train,
  To glide o’er the waves of the deluge fountain to the land of Erin,
  O’er Moy-n Eolarg, past Ben-Eigny. O’er Loch Feval,
  Where we should hear pleasing music from the swans,
  The host of gulls would make joyful, with eager singing,
  Should it reach the port of stern rejoicers, the _Dewy Red_,
  I am filled with wealth without Erin, did I think it sufficient.

  In the unknown land of my sojourn of sadness and distress,
  Alas, the voyage that was enjoined me, O King of secrets,
  For having gone myself to the battle of Cuil.
  How happy the son of Dima of the devout church
  When he hears in Durrow the desire of his mind
  The sound of the wind against the elms when ’tis played,
  The blackbird’s joyous note when he claps his wings,
  To listen at early dawn in Ros-grencha to the cattle,
  The cooing of the cuckoo from the tree on the brink of summer,
  Three objects I have left, the dearest to me on this peopled world,
  Durrow, Derry, the noble angelic land, and Tir-Luighdech,
  I have loved Erin’s land of cascades, all but its government.
  My visit to Comgall and feast with Cainnech was indeed delightful.

Of his Latin hymns only three remain. They are preserved in the _Liber
Hymnorum_, a MS. probably of the end of the eleventh century, and are
known as the “Altus,” “In te Christo,” and “Noli Pater.” No doubt exists
as to the genuineness of the “Altus.” It is the most famous of the
three, and is supposed to have been written after the battle of
Cooldrevna. The poem takes its name from the first word, and each of its
twenty-two stanzas begins in order with a letter of the alphabet,
probably as a help to the memory. The stanzas are rudely constructed,
with a kind of rhyme between every two lines. The poem has enjoyed a
great reputation, and has been variously rendered into English. Perhaps
the best translation is that of the Rev. Anthony Mitchell:—

                  Ancient of Days; enthroned on high;
                  The Father unbegotten He,
                  Whom space containeth not nor time,
                  Who was and is and aye shall be;
                  And one-born Son and Holy Ghost,
                  Who co-eternal glory share.
                  One only God of Persons Three
                  We praise, acknowledge and declare.

Attention has been directed by Dr. Dowden, Bishop of Edinburgh, to the
saint’s curious conceptions of the physical causes of clouds, and rain,
and tides, in the stanza beginning with I:—

               In the three quarters of the sea,
               Three mighty fountains hidden lie,
               Whence rise through whirling water-spouts,
               Rich-laden clouds that clothe the sky:
               On winds from out his treasure house,
               They speed to swell bud, vine, and grain;
               While the sea-shallows emptied wait
               Until the tides return again.

In the R stanza we have a picture of the judgment not unlike the “Dies
Iræ”:—

                Riseth the dawn:—the day is near
                Day of the Lord, the King of Kings;
                A day of wrath and vengeance just,
                Of darkness, clouds, and thunderings:
                A day of anguish, cries, and tears,
                When glow of women’s love shall pale;
                When man shall cease to strive with man,
                And all the world’s desires shall fail.

What now are we to think of this new literature and the other
productions, Latin and Gaelic, to which the monasteries of the period
gave rise? Is the Columban renaissance really a decadence in comparison
with what went before, the old unwritten inheritance? “Yes,” says
Darmesteter, and if we accept the antiquity of the oral tradition, I
think we must admit the truth of it. The sagas and historic tales, and
the poetry that is mingled with them, are of far greater importance from
a purely literary point of view. With a wild freedom of imagination and
an old-time conception of life untouched by Christian thought, they
breathe the spirit of pre-Christian ages, very much in the primitive
manner of Homeric poetry; and being intensely human and heroic, they
have a charm even for minds set to later ideals.

For example, in the _Colloquy or Dialogue of the Ancients_, it is
recorded that St. Patrick himself felt a little uneasy at the delight
with which he listened to the stories of the ancient Feinn, and in his
over-scrupulous sanctity he feared it might be wrong to appreciate and
enjoy so much, these worldly narratives. But when he consulted his two
guardian angels they not only assured him that there was no harm in
listening to the tales, but even desired him to get them written down in
the words of ollamhs, “for,” said these wise counsellors, “it will be a
rejoicing to numbers and to the good people to the end of time to listen
to these stories.”

Yet for all this the Columban period _was_ a renaissance. You cannot
spring a new creed and new ideas upon a nation without a reawakening of
thought and corresponding progress.

Over and above his own personal contributions to literature, Columba
helped forward the cause of letters in two other ways, namely, by
encouraging the bards and the scholars.

In his day the bards in Ireland had become an intolerable nuisance—idle,
numerous, and insolent; in fact they had developed into a loafing class,
who quartered themselves on the working-classes, on the chiefs and
farmers. They went about the country in bands, carrying a silver pot,
nicknamed by the people “the pot of Avarice.” Their tyranny was such
that he who refused to contribute was mercilessly satirised and
disgraced. Three attempts had been made to suppress them, but hitherto
to no purpose. At length Aedh, the High King of Ireland, considering
them to be too heavy a burden on the land, resolved to banish the whole
profession. Summoning a great Convention of all Ireland to Drumceat in
590 to settle important national affairs, he made this one of the chief
items. And the fate of the bardic institution would most certainly have
been sealed had not Columcille averted it. With 140 followers he had
crossed over to attend the Conference, and besides obtaining exemption
from military service for the women, and independence and freedom from
taxation for Dalriada, which was henceforth simply to help the parent
kingdom in affairs of war, he also succeeded in moderating the fury of
the chieftains against the bards. Their numbers were reduced and their
prestige abated, but the profession was amply compensated for this by
acquiring a new and recognised position in the State. No bards except
those specially sanctioned were to pursue the poetic calling. But for
the maintenance of these latter distinct public estates in land were set
apart for the first time, in return for which they were obliged to give
public instruction to all comers in the learning of the day, after the
manner of university professors. The rate of reward for their poems was
also legally fixed, so that from this time down to the seventeenth
century the bardic colleges, as distinct from the ecclesiastical ones,
taught poetry, law, and history, educating the lawyers, judges, and
poets of the Irish nation.

In recognition of the service rendered them on this occasion the bards
appeared before Columba in a body, with Dallan Forgaill, their chief, at
their head, bringing the famous “Amra” or elegy which the latter had
composed in his praise. This poem is in the Fenian dialect, so ancient
and obscure as to be very baffling and almost unintelligible to
scholars. It has come down to us heavily annotated with gloss and
commentary in the eleventh century MS. (Leabhar Na h’Uidhre). So far as
can be made out, it speaks of the saint in relation to the people as
“their soul’s light, their learned one, their chief from right, who was
God’s messenger, who dispelled fears from them, who used to explain the
truth of words, a harp without a base chord, a perfect sage who believed
in Christ; he was learned, he was chaste, he was charitable, he was an
abounding benefit of guests, he was eager, he was noble, he was gentle,
he was the physician of the heart of every age; he was to persons
inscrutable, he was a shelter to the naked, he was a consolation to the
poor, there went not from the world one who was more continual for a
remembrance of the cross.”

But a recent writer, Dr. Strachan of Manchester, casts doubts upon the
antiquity of its present form, thinking it belongs, as transcribed, to a
later date.

The other way in which St. Columba helped forward the cause of letters
was by encouraging the scholars. The monasteries became great schools of
learning as well as missionary centres. In all the institutions he
founded, ample provision was made for the multiplication of books. The
knowledge of Hebrew and Greek was fostered among the monks as well as of
Latin and Gaelic. To the monastic houses founded throughout Pictland by
the Columban clergy the tribes sent their youth to be trained. And for
several centuries, as Skene has observed, there was not a Pictish boy
taught his letters but received his education from a Columban monk. In
later times students from the Continent flocked to the more famous of
the Celtic seats of learning in Ireland and Scotland, and we even hear
of Iona sending professors to Cologne, Louvain, and Paris.

There is no evidence that the northern Picts had a knowledge of letters
before Columba taught them. There is even doubt as to what language
these tribes spoke. Yet in 710 A.D., a little more than a hundred years
after his death, a knowledge of letters was common in Pictland. With
reference to subsequent ecclesiastical changes, it is known that King
Naitan sent a proclamation “by public command throughout all the
provinces of the Picts to be transcribed, learned, and observed.” This
we have on the authority of Bede, a statement which shows that learning
must have made considerable progress among the people even at that early
date. So that in this respect we may very well endorse the opinion of
Professor Mackinnon, when he says that “we have not yet perhaps fully
realised the part which the School of Iona had in shaping the destinies
of the Scottish nation.” When in Scotland we discuss the past history of
our national education, the figure of John Knox invariably rises before
us as prime inaugurator of the first real system, but the great Abbot of
Iona was at it 1000 years before him.

Shaping the destinies of the Scottish nation; ay, and might we not add
of literature? For a further striking claim has been repeatedly put
forward on behalf of the Celtic poets in the Columban period, namely
this, that they taught Europe to rhyme. And this claim has been made not
so much by partisans as by some of the foremost European scholars,
including Zeuss and Nigra, who have remarked and pointed out that the
Latin verses of Columcille and other early saints, either rhyme or have
a strong tendency to rhyme. Referring to the advance towards final
assonance in later times made by the English in their Latin poems, Zeuss
says, “We must believe that this form was introduced among them by the
Irish, as were the arts of writing and of painting and of ornamenting
manuscripts, since they themselves, in common with the other Germanic
nations, made use in their poetry of nothing but alliteration.” It is
only some 500 years after Columba that we find rhyme beginning to appear
in English literature.

The other foreign writer of note, C. Nigra, with equal emphasis asserts
that “final assonance or rhyme can have been derived only from the laws
of Celtic phonology.” Meanwhile this must be regarded as a moot point.
For other eminent scholars, Thurneysen and Windisch, have professed
their opinion that it may be traced to the Latin. But “this at least is
clear,” observes Dr. Hyde, who has gone very carefully into the matter,
“that already in the seventh century the Irish not only rhymed, but made
intricate Deibhidh and other rhyming metres, when for centuries after
this period the Germanic nations could only alliterate.”

It is our proud boast as an English-speaking people that we can go back
as far as Cædmon to the beginnings of our literature; yet how few
British subjects realise that Gaelic was a literary language long before
then in the hands of men like St. Patrick, St. Columba, and Dallan
Forgaill, and that there are Latin MSS. still extant associated with
Columba and the School of Iona which are almost as old as the very
oldest existing codex of the Bible.

It is worth our while to think of this, and of the remarkable man who,
in the obscurity of his island home, recognised the value and permanence
of his own work, giving utterance to a sentiment which the ages have
amply verified: “Small and mean though this place is, yet it shall be
held in great and unusual honour, not only by Scotic kings and people,
but also by the rulers of foreign and barbarous nations, and by their
subjects; the saints also even of other churches shall regard it with no
common reverence.” And it is so. Systems and dynasties have since
fallen, yet the fame of Iona still stands secure, and continues to
attract the saint and the foreigner.




                               CHAPTER IV

Many Scottish visitors visit Schaffhausen, on the Rhine in Switzerland,
and perhaps few of them are aware that in the public library there, is
deposited one of the rarest and most interesting relics of Scotland.

It is a parchment MS. of sixty-eight leaves, each about eleven inches by
nine. The volume looks as if in the original binding. Its sides are of
beechwood, greatly worm-eaten and covered with calfskin, the sewing of
the back very rude and curious, and the front would seem to have been
formerly secured by clasps.

This is not a Gaelic work, though Gaelic names appear in it. It is
written in Latin in double columns. Capital letters abound, some of them
of great size and adorned with red and yellow paint. The summaries at
the beginning, the headings of chapters, and the colophon of the scribe
are all in rubric which on the whole is wonderfully fresh and beautiful.

Three handwritings may be traced: the first, that peculiar to the
greater part of the book; the second, in evidence towards the end, in
all probability the work of the same writer, but with different pen and
ink and in smaller, rounder letters; the third, corrections in spelling
by a later and much inferior penman.

The ink is dark, almost jet-black, except in some places where it has
turned brown.

Such is the general appearance of the relic. And marvel not if a vague,
far-away look steals into the eye when one reflects that this book which
he sees and handles is well nigh, if not quite, 1200 years old; that it
is, in fact, the oldest now existing, known to have been written in
Scotland, and separated by the lapse of 100 years from the next most
ancient.

A copy of Adamnan’s _Life of St. Columba_, made by one of his
contemporaries in Iona—this, the sturdy survival is taken to be. And if
the criteria of its age are not misleading, it dates from before 713
A.D. These criteria are in themselves profoundly interesting.

1. It is recognised that the handwriting is that peculiar heavy kind
found in the oldest Gaelic MSS.—not quite so round as that in the Books
of Kells and Durrow, but possessing many features in common, and
certainly anterior to that of the Book of Armagh, fixed at 807.

2. Similarly the Latin spelling corresponds with that of the more
ancient Celtic MSS. at home and abroad.

3. The Greek characters which appear in the text are in the semi-uncials
of the period, without accents or breathings.

4. The later corrections, supposed to have been made on the Continent,
are reckoned by Dr. Ferdinand Keller, an expert in the handwriting of
Charlemagne’s time, to belong to the period between 800 and 820.

5. The parchment is in goat-skin, in colour and condition extremely
ancient.

6. But more conclusive still is the remarkable colophon of the scribe at
the end of the volume, where he says, “I beseech those who wish to
transcribe these books, yea, rather, I adjure them by Christ, the judge
of the world, after they have diligently transcribed, carefully to
compare and correct their copies with that from which they have copied
them, and also to subjoin here this adjuration: ‘Whoever readeth these
books on the virtues of St. Columba let him pray to the Lord for me
Dorbene that after death I may possess eternal life.’”

Here we have actually the name of the scribe—a splendid clue to the age
of the MS. which critics have not been backward in availing themselves
of. The name is so rare in the records that they had only a choice
between two, one anterior to Adamnan’s day, the other his contemporary,
and Abbot-elect of Iona in 713. But this latter Dorbene died that same
year before assuming office, and only nine years after Adamnan himself.
He in all probability it was who copied the _Life_.

To the objection, Why not by another of the same name? Dr. Reeves
replies in effect, “Not likely, as the name is almost unique and
pointedly connected with the Columban society.” And to the further
objection that it might possibly be by a later hand from the autograph
of this Dorbene, he answers, “Even less likely, as the colophon in Irish
MSS. is always peculiar to the actual scribe, and usually omitted by
other transcribers. And this is the only MS. of Adamnan’s _Life_ that
has the name and the colophon.”

The interest attaching to it on account of its extraordinary age and
subject-matter is greatly enhanced when we consider its history. For the
old document had hairbreadth escapes and adventures, and if it could
speak for itself doubtless could unfold a tale infinitely more
surprising, because more real and tragic, than many of the miraculous
incidents it does record. All the long agony of the early, the middle,
and the modern ages has transpired since first it went a-wandering.
Invasions, crusades, and revolutions, the rise and fall of systems and
nations—whole populations passing swiftly and stormfully across the
bosom of Europe into oblivion, and the book in the heart of the troubled
area survives them all and emerges at length, as if from the debris, to
reassert that “there lived a man.”

Adamnan, ninth Abbot of Iona, wrote the original in the years 691 to
693—that is, ten or twelve years before his death, which occurred in
704. In the second preface—for there are two—he tells us that it is the
substance of the narratives learned from his predecessors, and is
founded either on written authorities anterior to his own time or on
what he heard himself from ancient men then living. And we know that he
was sufficiently near the fountainhead, both in time and place, to be
able to draw from authentic sources; for he wrote just a century after
St. Columba’s death, and at the urgent request of his brethren. In his
boyhood he had frequent opportunities of conversing with those who had
seen and known the saint, and he was surrounded in the monastery and in
the island with all the halo of association and piety in which the
memory of his hero was enshrined.

The written material he could rely on was not meagre even at so early a
date. There was the narrative of Cummene the Fair, seventh abbot of
Iona, and thus one of his own immediate predecessors. His account
Adamnan transferred entire and almost verbatim into the third book of
his own work. It was really a tract entitled _De virtutibus sancti
Columbæ_. In addition to this he had at least one other Latin memoir and
various Gaelic poems in praise of the saint, such as the “Amra” of
Dallan Forgaill, and those of Baithene Mòr, and perhaps of St. Mura.

In another of his books (_De Locis Sanctis_) the author informs us how
he generally set about composing his literary efforts. He wrote the
first draft on waxen tablets, revised and corrected it, and then from
the text so prepared, a clean copy was neatly written out on parchment.

Dorbene the Scribhnidh may have copied the _Life_ in Adamnan’s own time;
if not quite so early, then shortly after his death. And whatever became
of Adamnan’s original, Dorbene’s copy appears to have remained in the
monastery till the beginning of the ninth century, when it was probably
taken to Germany. At that time a strong tide of Scotic pilgrims set in
towards Central Europe, owing no doubt to the Norse invasions, which
rendered life and property insecure in Iona and elsewhere.

In 825 Blathmac was murdered in the monastery, along with several of the
brethren, because he refused to tell where the Columban relics were hid.
The likelihood is that after that narrow escape one of the fleeing monks
carried the book to St. Gall or Reichenau on the Rhine. At any rate it
is significant that Walafridus Strabus, formerly Dean of the Irish
monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland, and then Abbot of Reichenau from
842–849, knew of the tragic event and wrote a poem in Latin on the death
of Blathmac. And it was in this very house of Reichenau, that used to be
frequented so much by Scotic missionaries, that the MS. was ultimately
found. And quite casually too.

Ages had elapsed when, in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
Stephen White, a learned Irish Jesuit in search of Gaelic documents on
the Continent, luckily discovered it. He immediately transcribed the
venerable codex, and gave Ussher, Colgan, and the Bollandists the
benefit of his copy. Both the latter published the text—Colgan in 1647,
the Bollandists in 1698.

Thereafter, a second time the original vanished. When or how it was
removed from Reichenau is not known, but it must have been before that
monastery was suppressed in 1799. Once more it emerged, this time at
Schaffhausen, rediscovered by Dr. Ferdinand Keller of Zurich, the
distinguished archæologist.

Writing of the interesting find in January 1851, Dr. Keller tells the
story of its reappearance, showing into what sorry neglect it had fallen
before it reached its ultimate coign of vantage. “The present
_proprietor_ of the MS. of St. Columba,” he says, “is the town-library
of Schaffhausen. Here I found this codex in 1845 at the bottom of a high
book-chest, where it lay pell-mell with some other MSS. and old books
totally neglected, bearing neither title nor number.” It was twice
borrowed by Keller, and on the last occasion in 1851 he made a valuable
collection of facsimiles from it.

Finally the aged record, after well-nigh 1200 years’ vicissitudes, was
published by Dr. Reeves, Bishop of Down, in 1856, and his work
republished in 1874 by the publishers of the Series of Scottish
Historians, this time with English translation and re-arrangement of the
Notes, which Dr. Reeves permitted in order to adapt the book to a wider
circle of readers.

A truly romantic history, taking it all in all, is this story of the
ancient wanderer which has come to honour in a foreign land, but has not
yet found a way home to its native soil. What would Schaffhausen take
and part with it? Scotland has never asked. Some day she may, when she
awakens to the fact that the very oldest and, at the same time, one of
the most intensely interesting monuments of her literary history is an
alien in a strange country.

Apart from the book itself, the hero of the book, and its faithful
copyist, there is a fascination and much insight to be drawn from a
study of the personality of its author. Adamnan, like Boswell, has
achieved immortality through an enthusiastic and almost self-effacing
hero-worship. His great object, as he tells us again and again, is to
show up the wonderful character of the saintly Columba, and any deed or
tale that he thinks will enhance the prestige of this “great father and
founder of monasteries” goes down with unfailing devotion.

Born about the year 624 in Donegal, Adamnan, like Cummene, was a kinsman
of St. Columba. Indeed, the three men were descended from three
brothers, all of royal lineage. His peculiar name is understood to be a
diminutive of Adam, and is frequently followed by the patronymic Ua
Tinne, meaning grandson of Tinne. Of his father Ronan, or his mother
Ronnat, we know absolutely nothing beyond their descent, which was of
high degree. And of his own childhood and youth there remains only a
single legend, supposed to be the creation of a later age, reporting his
first meeting with Finnachta, afterwards monarch of Ireland, with whom
Adamnan was on the most friendly terms. This Finnachta, as his
biographer relates, was riding along one day to his sister’s house with
a numerous cavalcade, when he met a schoolboy with a jar of milk on his
back. In his haste to get out of the way the stripling knocked his foot
against a stone, and tripping, down went the jar with its contents upon
the ground. Whereupon the great prince spoke kindly to the boy and
assured him of protection, bidding him not to sorrow over it. To whom
the latter replied, “O good man, I have cause for grief, for there are
three goodly students in one house and three more of us are attendants
upon them. And how we act is this: one attendant from among us goes out
in turn to collect sustenance for the other five, and it was my turn
to-day; but what I had gathered for them has been spilled upon the
ground, and what grieves me more, the borrowed jar is broken and I have
not wherewith to pay for it.”

These are the boyish and dramatic circumstances in which Adamnan emerges
on the canvas of tradition. From his youth it would thus appear that he
was inured to hardship, and consequently qualified for the rigorous
discipline of the monastic life. Plain living went with high thinking,
and the quiet, thoughtful student soon acquired a reputation for
scholarship. He was just the kind of man to obtain entrance into the
distinguished circle of Iona, and though we cannot trace his career as
subordinate there, with certainty, we know that in 679, when fifty-five
years of age, he became head of the institution. At that period the
monastery was already known far and near for its learning. And there
seems little doubt that the new abbot was, taking him all in all, the
ablest and most accomplished of St. Columba’s successors. A great
linguist, he knew not only Latin, but, it may be inferred from his
writings, Hebrew and Greek also.

Four years prior to his own promotion, Finnachta had become king in his
native country. That monarch, it would appear, never lost sight of the
boy with the jar, whose whole bearing indicated a youth of rare promise.
The latter was afterwards invited to his court, and ultimately
constituted the king’s spiritual adviser (anamchara). This we have on
the authority of an ancient bardic composition in a vellum MS., formerly
in the possession of W. Monck Mason, Esq.

Besides his interesting relations with Finnachta, Adamnan was fortunate
in possessing the friendship of King Aldfrid of Northumbria. This
intimacy probably dates from the time when the latter as prince had
occasion to seek refuge in Ireland from his intriguing foes. At that
time he may have even been, as Duald Mac Firbis’s annals affirm, a pupil
of Adamnan.

At any rate, with two such royal friends, the influence of the Ionan
abbot was very great. And on important occasions he served as ambassador
or “go-between” in matters of State betwixt the two kings. For example,
after a raiding expedition by the North Saxons on Meath, Finnachta got
him to undertake a mission to his friend Aldfrid to negotiate for the
return of the captives, and the abbot had the satisfaction of personally
conducting sixty of them back to Erin in 686.

Two years later he paid another visit to the Court in Northumbria. On
both occasions a dreadful plague was raging in that country, and
throughout a great part of Europe. In his usual ultra-rational manner
Adamnan attributes his own immunity from the pestilence, and that of the
Picts and Scots in general, to the intercession of his holy patron St.
Columba.

On these tours he made the acquaintance of the leading clergy in the
north of England. It is supposed he met Bede, then a young man, at the
Court also. This distinguished historian gives various facts regarding
the abbot and his movements. He appears to have read Adamnan’s book on
the “Holy Places,” though it may be that he never saw the biography,
which was a much later production. At least he makes no mention of it
anywhere.

There were two great questions that then divided the Celtic churches—the
celebration of Easter and the tonsure. Through his intercourse with the
English clergy in Northumbria, and more especially, it is affirmed,
through a lively discussion he had with the learned Ceolfrid, Abbot of
Jarrow, Adamnan was persuaded to adopt the Catholic in preference to the
Celtic usage in these matters. On his return to Hy the brethren
strenuously opposed the innovation, and there was a lasting difference
of opinion thus originated by his change of views. For years the abbot,
who was pre-eminently a man of peace and unity—and, like the great and
pious scholar he was, always open to conviction,—earnestly strove to win
them over to what he deemed to be the better method, but did not succeed
in his own lifetime, though in after years the change was ultimately
adopted. In 692 he visited Ireland, and again in 697, between which
years he wrote the book that has made his name and memory immortal. A
man of great energy and incessant diligence, he was much on the move
convening synods and negotiating affairs. Like his extraordinary patron,
he interested himself in politics as well as in religion and literature,
of which he was a shining light.

Unhappily the law which St. Columba had got enacted, exempting women
from fighting in actual warfare, had soon fallen into abeyance, and
Adamnan resolved to have it re-enacted. According to a legend in the
Leabhar Breac and Book of Lecain, his attention was called to the
inhuman custom in the following accidental way. One day he happened to
be travelling through the plain of Bregia, says the legend, with his
mother on his back, when they saw two armies in deadly conflict. During
the heat of the combat his mother’s eye caught sight of a woman dragging
another woman by means of an iron reaping-hook from the opposing
battalion. The hook was fastened in the unfortunate victim’s breast.
Sitting down overcome by the sight, the distressed Ronnat said to her
son, “Thou shalt not take me from this spot until thou exemptest women
for ever from being in this condition and from excursions and hostings.”
Adamnan promised it. And at the important Synod of Tara, convened in
697, with the approval of King Finnachta, the point was carried,
involving a mighty social revolution from henceforth in the life and
customs of the Gael. For under the old regime, men and women went
equally to battle.

The enactments of this synod were afterwards known in Latin as “Lex
Adamnani,” and in Gaelic “Cain Adhamhnain.” In addition to a certain
privilege conceded to him and to his successors of levying contributions
for sacred purposes, Dr. Reeves thinks it was on this occasion that the
questions of Easter and the tonsure were publicly discussed, and
Adamnan’s views and usage adopted in Ireland.

Afterwards he seems to have been some years in that country promoting
his reforms. He certainly was there in 701; and Bede mentions that he
crossed from Erin to Hy the summer of the year that he died, and
indicates that he had been there a considerable time previously. His
death occurred on September 23rd, 704. It is thus touchingly
commemorated by the great historian. “For it came to pass that before
the next year came round he departed this life; the Divine goodness so
ordering it that, as he was a man most earnest for peace and unity, he
should be taken away to everlasting life before the return of the season
of Easter he should be obliged to differ still more seriously from those
who were unwilling to follow him in the way of truth.” He had apparently
celebrated his last Easter in Ireland, and died at the mature age of
seventy-seven.

His fame rests on his writings, chiefly the _Life of St. Columba_, and
his book on the “Holy Places”—_De Locis Sanctis_. Adamnan himself saw
not these Holy Land localities, but a French bishop on his return from
the east was driven by a storm to spend the winter with Adamnan, who
took down on waxen tablets his interesting accounts of the chief places
visited, and afterwards wrote out, _brevi textu_, on parchment. It is
better written and more fluent even than the biography, and when found
many years after, it was published as “the earliest account coming from
modern Christian Europe of the condition of Eastern lands and the cradle
of Christianity.”

Adamnan presented the book to King Aldfrid of Northumbria. There are
extant MSS. of it as old as the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries still
on the Continent—at Rome, Corbey, Saltzburg, and other places.

Besides these chief Latin works he is credited with a _Life of St.
Patrick_; poems, quoted by Tighernach, the “Four Masters,” and the Book
of Lecain; a _History of Ireland_ to his own times, and _An Epitome of
Irish Laws in Metre_. These two latter are only mentioned by Ward[16]
(on what authority is not known), and may be probably only compilations
of more modern times.

In the _Liber Hymnorum_, however, there is a short hymn in Gaelic
entitled Adamnan’s Prayer. It may be read in Dr. Stokes’ _Goidelica_.
And in the Leabhar Na h’Uidhre there is a more lengthy production known
as “Fis Adhamhnain.” It is in the form of a sermon, and may have been
written down some two hundred years after the abbot’s time. In this
remarkable vision Adamnan figures as “the high sage of the western
world,” and like Aeneas or Dante, he is privileged on the festival of
St. John the Baptist to visit heaven and hell. The scenes he beheld are
depicted in the original Gaelic with a realism and power of vivid
imaginary detail that puts even Thomas Boston in the shade. As Dante
found his Florentine enemies in not too comfortable circumstances in the
Inferno, so Adamnan is here represented as seeing the Aircinnich—the lay
administrators of the church lands, who too often abused their trust, in
similar dool. But this sentiment alone is sufficient to show that the
composition is of later date than Adamnan’s day, for such Aircinnich had
yet to arise, and the broad acres they mismanaged.

It is said that at the time of the great Synod in 697 the public mind
had for long been kept in such a state of suspense and alarm by the
prevailing pestilences and portents, that the report of the abbot having
some such vision made it so susceptible to his influence that he had far
less difficulty in carrying into effect his revolutionary measures than
he would have had in ordinary circumstances.

But all these things—writings and traditions alike—tend to show how this
quiet, intellectual, studious, pious, and—from our point of
view—amazingly credulous, yet influential scholar, impressed his own and
succeeding ages.

Adamnan’s best known book is essentially a Life of St. Columba, written
not in any chronological order, but on a characteristic plan of his own.
There are two prefaces, and what would really be the gist and
subject-matter of a modern biography is condensed by him into one short
paragraph at the end of the second of these. The work is then divided
into three parts or books. The first deals with prophetical revelations,
the second with miracles, the third with visions of angels; and under
these titles he groups all the most striking stories of the saint’s
life. All the collateral information—and it is not much—regarding the
history of the time, the social life, the manners, customs, language,
topography, etc., we get merely by the way in the telling of the tale.
Adamnan apparently had no thought that his readers would wish to know
something of these, or if he had he did not deem it any part of his task
to enlighten them. He was writing for his own times, and he could not
conceive that the eye of any monk or other reader could wander off from
the central luminary to mere details of the environment. It is at once
the limitation and strength of the enthusiast and the specialist. How
could he know that he was writing for the far-distant future?—this
unassuming monk in his cell, unconsciously addressing a people who have
emerged from his theory of the universe, and who listen and wonder at
his stories, which to them have all the charm and interest of fairy
tales.

_Tempora mutantur, eheu!_ The little facts that incidentally dropped
from his pen are those most sought and valued now, while the miracles,
visions, and prophecies which he took to be the soul and substance of
the book, wear a different aspect to modern eyes. It is these trifling
details, sometimes mere names, that give us glimpses into the state of
society in Ireland and Pictland, and into the civil and ecclesiastical
history of the time.

Adamnan’s consuming desire at all times is to present “the evidences
which the venerable man gave of his power.” And when we reflect that he
believed that “by some divine intuition” St. Columba, “through a
wonderful experience of his inner soul, beheld the whole universe drawn
together and laid open to his sight, as in one ray of the sun,” we need
not be surprised at the wonders unfolded. In the first chapter of Book
I., and before entering upon illustrative examples, he gives a summary
of his hero’s supernatural qualities. For example, he healed diseases;
expelled from the island “innumerable hosts of malignant spirits, whom
he saw with his bodily eyes assailing himself and beginning to bring
deadly distemper on his monastic brotherhood.” The surging waves quickly
became quiet at his prayer, and contrary winds changed into fair. He
took a white stone from the river Ness and blessed it for healing
purposes. This famous pebble floated like an apple when placed in water.
In the country of the Picts he raised a dead child to life, and while
yet a young man in Hibernia turned water into wine. An immense blaze of
heavenly light was occasionally seen to surround him in the light of
day, and he was frequently favoured with the society of bright hosts of
celestial beings. He often saw just men carried by angels to the highest
heavens, and reprobates hurried by demons to hell. The blessed man even
foretold the destinies of individual men, pleasing or painful, according
to their deserts. And “in the dreadful crash of wars he obtained from
God by the virtue of prayer, that some kings should be conquered and
others come off victorious.”

And now, coming to the substance of the separate books in order, we need
not dwell on the prophetical revelations, numerous and curious though
they are, beyond giving one or two as typical examples. The credulity of
the author and his capacity for belief are passing strange, and even
foreign to an age like our own. A peasant, he tells us, once asked the
saint by what death he would die. “Not in the battlefield nor at sea,”
came the ready response, “but the travelling companion of whom thou hast
no suspicion shall cause thy death.” And the man died through the
effects of a wound accidentally caused by his own knife.

One wonderful experience may be quoted, as quite in line with Professor
James’ argument in his Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh University (May,
1901). In discussing “The reality of the Unseen,” this brilliant
exponent of the new Psychology instanced a number of curious cases of
the occurrence of a “presence” to individuals, and he maintained that
the sentiment of reality could indeed attach itself to things of which
the representative faculty could frame only the dimmest sort of an idea.
And abstractions other than the ideas of pure reason had the power of
making us feel presences that we were impotent articulately to describe.
No more striking example of his contention could be desired than the
following. It is entitled, “Of the consolation which the monks when they
were weary on their journey, received from the saint visiting them in
spirit.”

Baithene and the brethren were returning in the evening to the monastery
from the harvest work when something strange and unusual was felt by
them all. It is thus described by an elder brother. “I perceive,” he
said to the others, “the fragrance of such a wonderful odour, just as if
all the flowers on earth were gathered together into one place. I feel
also a glow of heat within me, not at all painful, but most pleasing,
and a certain unusual and inexpressible joy poured into my heart, which
on a sudden so refreshes and gladdens me that I forget grief and
weariness of every kind. Even the load, however heavy, which I carry on
my back, is in some mysterious way so lightened from this place all the
way to the monastery that I do not seem to have any weight to bear.”

King Brude and his Druids had rather a different sensation when, outside
their fortifications near Inverness, some of the latter tried to prevent
the saint from chanting the evening hymns. Very much in the flesh this
time, St. Columba began to sing the 44th Psalm so wonderfully loud, like
the rattle of thunder, that king and people were terror-struck with the
awful noise, and forthwith relented. Columba seems to have been more
than a match for these pagan opponents. For in the second book, where
the miracles are recorded, among other confusions to which he drove the
resisting Picts, the following is recorded. When first he visited Brude,
it happened that the king, elated by the pride of royalty, acted
haughtily and would not open his gates to his distinguished visitors.
But the man of God, observing this, approached the folding doors with
his companions and, having first formed upon them the sign of the cross,
he knocked and then laid his hand upon the gate, which instantly flew
open of its own accord, the bolts sliding back with great force. The
saint and his followers then passed through, and ever after, as long as
he lived, king Brude knew how to respect and reverence his imperious
visitor. It was to him that the latter gave the remarkable white pebble
which effected cures. “And what is very wonderful,” says our author,
“when this same stone was sought for by those sick persons whose term of
life had arrived, it could not be found.” Even King Brude himself was
abandoned _in articulo mortis_ by the fateful pebble.

After giving examples of miraculous punishments inflicted on those who
were opposed to St. Columba, Adamnan instances a few encounters with
wild beasts, and as they relate to our own Scotland they are of ancient
and exceptional interest.

“On one occasion,” to quote our author, “when the blessed man was
staying some days in the Scian island (Skye), he left the brethren and
went alone a little farther than usual to pray; and having entered a
dense forest he met a huge wild boar that happened to be pursued by
hounds. As soon as the saint saw him at some distance he stood looking
intently at him. Then raising his holy hand and invoking the name of God
in fervent prayer, he said to the beast, ‘Thou shalt proceed no farther
in this direction; perish on the spot where thou hast now reached.’ And
no sooner were these fateful words uttered than it appears his
formidable opponent collapsed, expiring on the spot.”

But an experience on the mainland of the Picts seems to have been even
more exciting. One day he had to cross the river Ness. And when he
reached the bank of the river he saw some of the inhabitants burying an
unfortunate man, who, according to the accounts of those who were
burying him, was a short time before seized as he was swimming, and
bitten most severely by a monster that lived in the water; his wretched
body was, though too late, taken out with a hook by those who came to
his assistance in a boat. The blessed man, on hearing this, was so far
from being dismayed that he directed one of his companions to swim over
and row across the coble that was moored at the farther bank. And Lugne
Mocumin, hearing the command of the excellent man, obeyed without the
least delay, taking off all his clothes except his tunic and leaping
into the water. But the monster, which, so far from being satiated, was
only roused for more prey, was lying at the bottom of the stream, and
when it felt the water disturbed by the man swimming, suddenly rushed
out, and giving an awful roar darted after him with its mouth wide open,
as the man swam in the middle of the stream. Then the blessed man,
observing this, raised his holy hand, while all the rest, brethren as
well as strangers, were stupefied with terror, and invoking the name of
God, formed the saving sign of the cross in the air, and commanded the
ferocious monster, saying, “Thou shalt go no farther, nor touch the man;
go back with all speed.” Then at the voice of the saint the monster was
terrified, and fled more quickly than if it had been pulled back with
ropes, though it had just got so near Lugne as he swam that there was
not more than the length of a spear staff between the man and the beast.
Then the brethren, seeing that the monster had gone back, and that their
comrade Lugne had returned to them in the boat safe and sound, were
struck with admiration and gave glory to God in the blessed man. And
even the barbarous heathens who were present were forced, by the
greatness of this miracle which they themselves had seen, to magnify the
God of the Christians.

The raising of the hand and forming the sign of the cross in the air
seems to have been a frequent and effective expedient. In the case of a
youth who was returning from the milking of the cows with his pail on
his back, and who stopped at the door of the cell where the blessed man
was writing, it was the means of driving out a demon that lurked in the
milk pail. No sooner had he left than the saint made the sign. Instantly
the air was greatly agitated. The bar which fastened the lid of the pail
being pulled back through the two openings which received it, was shot
away to a great distance, while the lid fell to the earth and the
greater part of the milk was spilled upon the ground. The demon that
lurked in the bottom of the pail could not endure the power of the sign,
and fled thus violently in terror.

Such is the unvarying style of Adamnan. That he himself credited those
versions of stories reported is beyond question. “Our belief in the
miracles which we have recorded,” he says, “but which we did not
ourselves see, is confirmed beyond doubt by the miracles of which we
were eye-witnesses.” Three times in his own experience he saw
unfavourable gales changed into propitious breezes.

As Book III., dealing with visions and angels, embodies Cummene’s
contribution, it is of the highest interest to consider some of its
choice memories. “On a certain night,” proceeds chap. ii., “between the
conception and birth of the venerable man, an angel of the Lord appeared
to his mother in dreams, bringing to her as he stood by her a certain
robe of extraordinary beauty, in which the most beautiful colours, as it
were, of all the flowers seemed to be portrayed. After a short time he
asked it back and took it out of her hands, and having raised it and
spread it out he let it fly through the air. But she, being sad at the
loss of it, said to that man of venerable aspect, ‘Why dost thou take
this lovely cloak away from me so soon?’ He immediately replied,
‘Because this mantle is so exceedingly honourable that thou canst not
retain it longer with thee.’ When this was said, the woman saw that the
forementioned robe was gradually receding from her in its flight, and
that then it expanded until its width exceeded the plains, and in all
its measurements was larger than the mountains and forests. Then she
heard the following words, ‘Woman, do not grieve for the man to whom
thou hast been bound by the marriage bond; thou shalt bring forth a son
of so beautiful a character that he shall be reckoned among his own
people as one of the prophets of God, and he hath been predestined by
God to be the leader of innumerable souls to the heavenly country.’ At
these words the woman awoke from her sleep.”

A priest, to whose care the sacred youth had been confided, upon
returning home from the church after mass found his house illuminated
with a bright light, and saw in fact a ball of fire standing over the
face of the little boy as he lay asleep. And in after years a higher
personage, St. Brendan, reported that he observed a most brilliant
pillar wreathed with fiery tresses preceding the same wonderful
individual.

It was not to be supposed that such a distinguished ornament of the
church militant could escape the attention and intrigues of its
arch-enemy. And so, on another day, while the holy man went to seek in
the woods of Iona for a place more remote from men and fitting for
prayer, he suddenly beheld, as he afterwards told a few of the brethren,
a very black host of demons fighting against him with iron darts. These
wicked demons, as the Holy Spirit revealed to the saint, wished to
attack his monastery and kill with the same spears many of the brethren.
But he, single-handed, against innumerable foes of such a nature, fought
with the utmost bravery, having received the armour of the apostle Paul.
And thus the contest was maintained on both sides during the greater
part of the day, nor could the demons, countless though they were,
vanquish him; nor was he able by himself to drive them from his island
until the angels of God—as the saint afterwards told certain persons—and
they few in number came to his aid, when the demons in terror gave way.

The chapter, which is far and away the most thrilling and humanly
interesting, is the last of the volume, entitled, “How our patron Saint
Columba passed to the Lord.” It lingers with loving memory over the
closing scene of this remarkable life, giving a minute account of the
saint’s last words and acts, his preparations for the impending change,
and the manner and circumstances of his death. But as this is an
oft-repeated and well-known passage, it need not be quoted here.

Adamnan’s _Vita Columbæ_ is not the only ancient _Life of St. Columba_
after Cummene’s, but it is undoubtedly the standard classic one, from
which most of the subsequent biographies draw their facts and
inspirations, with the exception, perhaps, of the “Old Irish Life,”
which furnishes particulars not mentioned in this one.

Neither is the Schaffhausen document the sole existing MS. copy of the
great biography. Dr. Reeves consulted as many as seven distinct MSS.,
three of which contained a longer and four a shorter text. Besides these
he had heard of five other extant copies, more or less complete.

The seven from which he obtained his own various readings are the

With all its defects, Adamnan’s masterpiece is the most valuable
monument of the early Celtic Church which has escaped the ravages of
time; imaginative, superstitious, magical, and steeped in hero-worship,
it is characteristically Celtic and of surpassing interest to the
archæologist and philologist.

Its value as such would have been vastly enhanced in these times had it
been written in Gaelic, and doubtless, too, had the author condescended
more on social and historical details. But Adamnan apparently had no
high opinion of his native language as a literary medium. In his first
preface he almost apologises for using Gaelic names of men and tribes
and obscure places in the “base Scotic tongue,” which he thinks rude in
comparison with the languages of foreign nations, and begs his readers
not to despise a record of useful deeds on account of these native words
inserted.

Dr. Reeves seems to regret that Adamnan did not follow the method of
Bede and give us an ecclesiastical history instead of a biography. We
cannot all share his sentiment. Had it been other than it is—had it even
been in Gaelic—the probability is that it might not have survived. In
Gaelic it certainly never could have attained the celebrity it enjoyed
on the continent of Europe during the Middle Ages, and which helped to
perpetuate it. On the other hand, without the memoir as thus preserved,
the life of St. Columba, the greatest pioneer of Scottish history,
religion, and literature, would now be as vague and jumbled as that of
any mythical hero, even as that of the historical St Patrick outside his
own “Confession” unfortunately is; and we should be ignorant of many
points concerning which we have now first-hand information.

As it stands, the _Vita Columbæ_ is still the most authentic voucher we
have for various important particulars in the civil and religious
history of the Picts and Scots, and the severe Pinkerton himself was
perhaps never nearer the truth on Celtic subjects than when he
pronounced it “the most complete piece of such biography that all Europe
can boast of, not only at so early a period, but even through the whole
Middle Ages.”




                               CHAPTER V

      from?—Its contents threefold—Gaelic colophon from the ninth
      century—The work of a native scribe of Alba—Peculiarities—The
      ecclesiastical art of the period—The Gaelic entries—“Legend of
      Deer”—Drostan’s tears—Some very quaint history—The earliest source

      native origin that Cambridge can boast of.


In the year 1860, Mr. Henry Bradshaw, Librarian of Cambridge University,
while rummaging among old books, came upon a curious production which at
once usurped his attention. Here, thought he, is surely a survival from
some remote time. And examining the MS., he found it to consist of
eighty-six parchment leaves, six inches long, four and a half wide, and
closely written on both sides.

The language was Latin, written in the Irish character, “not very unlike
the Bodleian Cædmon.” Each page showed marks of ruling with a sharp
instrument, and the letters hung from the ruled lines instead of resting
on them. The pages were surrounded by ornamented borders, most of them
filled in with interlaced work in panels, and with fretwork of a
peculiar kind.

On a casual inspection of the subject-matter, the accomplished librarian
had no difficulty in ascertaining that it consisted of the first six
chapters of St Matthew’s Gospel, and part (verses 1–22) of the seventh;
the first four chapters of St. Mark, and part of the fifth (to middle of
verse 35); the first three chapters of St. Luke, with the first verse of
the fourth; the whole of the Gospel of St. John; a fragment of an Office
for the Visitation of the Sick, in a later hand; and the Apostles’
Creed. The writing of the Gospels was all in one uniform hand, the ink
dark-brown with age, and the initial letters of paragraphs designed in
fanciful dragonesque forms and variously coloured. At the end of the
book, just after the Apostles’ Creed, the writer had added a colophon in
another language, which looked like Gaelic, and on the margins and
vacant spaces of the volume there was a number of entries in the same
vernacular, but evidently inserted much later.

What greatly enhanced the rarity and interest of this remarkable codex,
in the finder’s eyes, was that it also contained a collection of
coloured pictures and ornamental designs contemporary with the writing,
executed in the same style, and apparently by the same hand that penned
the Gospels.

Where did this ancient curio come from? It was easy for him to trace its
entrance into the Library, for he found it among the remainder of the
books of John Moore, at one time Bishop of Norwich, and later of Ely.
These books had come into the possession of the University in a very
interesting way. After the prelate’s death, which took place in 1714, it
appears that King George the First, acting on the suggestion of Lord
Townshend, bought the extensive library of the deceased for the sum of
6000 guineas, and gifted it to the College Library.

The small octavo MS. of which we are speaking, and now known as the Book
of Deer, had formed part of Bishop Moore’s collection in 1697, and
strange to say, after its removal to Cambridge, it lay apparently
neglected for a century and a half on the shelves of that University
Library, until the discriminating eye of Mr. Bradshaw singled it out as
of exceptional antiquity and value—as, in fact, one of the very oldest
MSS. of native origin that Cambridge can boast of.

Thus far the history of the quaint foundling. For the rest, it must tell
its own tale.

Obviously one of the few relics of the Celtic Church now extant, it
required an expert in the Gaelic language and antiquities to elicit the
desired information regarding its origin and long past. And when Whitley
Stokes sought a perusal, we can almost fancy the eager Bradshaw
addressing his fellow-linguist in the language of Marcellus to Horatio
when the ghost of Hamlet’s father suddenly appeared, “Thou art a
scholar; speak to it.” Here was the worn and faded form of a book
resurrected from the dust of oblivion, and, like the shade of the dead
king, once more catching the eye of men, and making their hearts quiver
with eerie curiosity.

A rising Celticist, Mr. Whitley Stokes soon applied himself to the
interesting inquisition, following the venerable scroll back for a
thousand years to the ancient time when it first took shape. And in the
_Saturday Review_ of December 1860 appeared an anonymous article from
his pen, in the form of an appreciative notice, giving translations of
the Gaelic, and otherwise making known to the public the importance of
this latest literary discovery.

In the contents of the volume he found sufficient internal evidence to
be able to trace its past, so far as many details of its early origin
and environment are concerned.

These contents, as already hinted, are threefold. First, the original
substance of the book; second, its ornamentations; and third, the notes
and memoranda inserted at a later time on the margins and blank pages.

And into what age and environment, we naturally ask, do these lead us?

As on receipt of an unknown letter, the receiver turns with eager eyes
to scan the signature at the end, so here the expert first directs his
attention to the colophon or postscript of the scribe.

In this particular instance it happens to be in Gaelic, and may be
rendered thus: “Be it on the conscience of every one in whom shall be
for grace the booklet with splendour, that he give a blessing on the
soul of the poor wretch (truagain) who wrote it” (“Forchubus caichduini
imbia arrath inlebran colli aratardda bendacht forainmain in truagain
rodscribai”).

This Gaelic, says Whitley Stokes, is identical with the oldest Irish
glosses given by Zeuss in his _Grammatica Celtica_, and “certainly as
old as the ninth century.” Professor Westwood, from a study of the
written characters, which are those at that time common to the Irish and
Anglo-Saxon schools, came to the same conclusion as to the age of the
book.

The version of the Gospels which it contains is one of a class which has
been called “Irish,” because, while mainly corresponding with Jerome’s
Vulgate, it preserves occasional readings from versions of earlier
dates. The text, in other words, agrees with the text of the various
Books of Gospel used in the Scoto-Irish monasteries of the period, such
as the Books of Durrow, Kells, Dimna, Moling, Armagh, etc.

It would appear that Jerome’s recension made its way early among Gaelic
scholars, and during the isolation of the Celtic Church, there had been
a sort of revision which produced a native version exhibiting
characteristics peculiar to itself and common to all the above-mentioned
texts. Hence the wonderful uniformity alike in the text and in the
peculiarities of spelling found in all the surviving Gaelic MSS. of that
early period.

It is not known whether the book was produced in the place whose name it
bears or in Iona, or whether it was written by a Pict or a Scot.
Scholars are content to affirm their opinion that it is the work of a
native scribe of Alba, without particularising too confidently.

Dr. Stuart, who edited it for the Spalding Club in 1869, observed that
though the handwriting is good and uniform, casual examination of the
MS. will show that it is a careless transcript of a corrupt text. The
spelling is frequently barbarous and capricious. There are many
violations of grammar, with omissions, transpositions, repetitions and
interpolations of various kinds, while the prepositions are almost
always joined to the word which they govern.

Generally speaking, this Book of Deer exhibits many of the peculiarities
of spelling which Tischendorf noted in the Vulgate, for example:—

                      Magdalen_æ_ for Magdalen_e_.
                      Ba_b_tismum for ba_p_tismum.
                      O_cc_ulus for o_c_ulus.
                      Abra_ch_am for Abra_h_am.
                      _Ch_anna for _C_ana.
                      Pro_f_eta for pro_ph_eta.
                      Dic_ie_ns for dic_e_ns.
                      _Z_abulus for _d_iabolus.
                      _H_oriens for _o_riens, etc.

But the copying is otherwise of such a kind that it appears very
doubtful if the scribe really knew Latin well. It certainly indicates a
great falling away from the high scholarship of Adamnan and the verbal
accuracy of Baithene. And this itself might confirm us in the idea that
it may have been written in Deer or somewhere in Buchan rather than in
Iona. Very curious blunders might be quoted; but perhaps none more
grotesque than that in the genealogy in St. Luke, where Seth is set down
as the first man and father of Adam, or again in John xviii. 22, “Sic
respondis Pontifici” (Answerest thou the high priest so?) is written
“Sicrespem dispontifici.” In other cases words are introduced which
entirely destroy the sense.

The second feature of this remarkable codex to arrest the attention, is
the decoration, which also is found to exhibit the character of the
ecclesiastical art of the period at which it is presumed to have been
written. The style of ornament of the illuminations is in fact entirely
similar to that used in the well known Irish Books of Gospel prior to
the ninth century, and on its own account is exceedingly interesting.
The first folio has its page divided into four panels by a plain Latin
cross, with a rosette in the centre. In these are four figures
representing, most likely, the four evangelists, though they might very
well stand for clerics. Fronting the beginning of the first Gospel is a
figure, full-page size, taken to represent St. Matthew, the author of
that Evangel. He appears with a beard, and clothed in ecclesiastical
vestments, all but the feet, which are bare. In his right hand he holds
a sword of unusual form, turned downwards with the point of the scabbard
resting between his feet; the handle is guarded before and behind, the
guards being curved and reversed.

On either side of the evangelist there looks forth a smaller figure,
which seems to be intended for an angel.

At the beginning of St. Mark’s Gospel is another figure in the same
style, with an object in front of his breast like a book in ornamental
binding. In his own place, St. Luke appears in the attitude of prayer,
his arms outspread. St. John is surrounded by six smaller figures,
similar to those accompanying St. Matthew. The two last pages of the MS.
have also designs of which one repeats with variations that at the
beginning of the book; while the other is a combination of similar
figures with geometric ornament. Throughout the volume are found here
and there small drawings—quaint little flourishes representing fern
leaves, birds, and animals, curiously wrought, and words as if in trial
of the pen, some of which show very delicate and correct lines. The
initial letter of each Gospel is enlarged and ornamented with patches of
different colours, about two inches high, and the ends of the principal
strokes of the letters terminate in dogs’ heads.

Yet it must be added that with all its similarity of style and
attractive colouring, the art is poor in comparison with that of
contemporary Irish MSS.

Such are the original contents of the codex. There remain the later
notes and memoranda on the margins and blank spaces. And these are of
two kinds—those written in Latin and those in Gaelic. The Latin ones
consist of (1) the fragment of an Office for the Visitation of the Sick
inserted between Mark and Luke, and with a single line of Gaelic rubric
in the body of it, namely, “Hisund dubeir sacorfaic dau” (“Here give the
sacrifice to him”); (2) a Charter by King David confirming to the monks
of Deer their lands and their privileges. As the Office for the Sick may
have been the first insertion, perhaps 200 or 250 years after the
original book was written, so the King’s Charter, granted some time
before his death in 1154, was with a single exception apparently the
last, for in declaring that the clerics of Deer were free from all lay
interference and undue exaction, “as it is written in their book,” it is
implied that the rest of the entries had already been made.

These latter are the six Gaelic ones, and they contribute the chief
value to the Book of Deer. They all relate to grants of land and other
privileges given from time to time to the Monastery of that name. At
Banff and Aberdeen, in the early part of the twelfth century, the book
was produced in the King’s Courts in evidence of the rights of the
clerics to the land in question, and their claim was thereby
substantiated. The entries were made at different times, from the end of
the tenth or the beginning of the eleventh century down to the middle of
the twelfth. They occur in the earlier part of the book, and though
inferior in point of penmanship and even of ink to the original contents
of the MS., they are well written and perfectly legible throughout.
Inscribed as they were in the Gaelic of the place and of the period,
these entries introduce us direct and at once into the community of
monks who owned the codex.

The first is of exceeding great interest. It is known as the “Legend of
Deer.” Based upon a tradition of some 500 years, it cannot be regarded
as strictly historical, which all the others are. The tradition was that
the monastery of Deer was founded by St. Columba. According to the
legend, the great Abbot came with his pupil Drostan from Hy (Iona) to
Abbordoboir, the modern Aberdour in Aberdeenshire, but whether by land
or sea is not stated. The record simply says, “As God had directed
them.” Bede the Pict was, at the time, Mormaer or Grand Steward of
Buchan, and gave them the town in freedom for ever from mormaer and
toisech (chieftain). They came after that to the other town of the
district, now known as Deer, and “it was pleasing to Columcille because
it was full of God’s grace,” and he asked Bede to give him that one too,
but the Pict refused.

Then a son of this ruler took ill and was at the point of death, when
his father sent to the clerics—Columba and his pupil—to pray for the lad
that he might recover, and he gave them in offering the land from “Cloch
in tiprat to Cloch pette meic Garnait” (“From the stone of the well to
the stone that marks the bounds of the son of Garnat’s place”). They
offered a prayer and health came to the dying youth. After that,
Columcille departed from the district, gifting the town to Drostan. But
before he set out he blessed it, and left as his “word,” “Whosoever
shall come against it, let him not be many-yeared or victorious.”

Drostan’s tears (deara), we are told, flowed freely on parting with his
famous Chief, whereupon the immortal Columba said, “Let Dear be its name
henceforward.” And thus the town and monastery derived their name, since
variously spelt as Dear, Der, Deir, Dere, and Deer.

The facts underlying the legend are not at all improbable. On the
contrary, they are quite in keeping with the character of St. Columba
and the range of his mission. Arguing from the circumstance that no
Drostan is mentioned in history in connection with the saint, an attempt
has been made by Dr. Macbain to show that the founder of the monastery
may have been another individual of that name who lived about 700 A.D.,
but there is no sufficient data. The word is a diminutive of the British
name Drust. And whoever Drostan was, as a saint he has been held in
honour in the Buchan district from very early times. The church of
Aberdour was dedicated to him, and Drustie’s fair used to be held
annually at Deer on the 14th of December.

In connection with the “word” said to have been left by Columcille,
there is some very quaint history in after years. The Celtic Earls of
Buchan, partly influenced by it, no doubt, showed a munificent spirit
towards the Church of Deer till the fall of their House with the Comyns,
when Robert the Bruce came to the throne.

The Comyns had opposed the latter and were so utterly overthrown that,
according to a chronicle of the period, of a name which numbered at one
time the three Earls of Buchan, Mar, and Menteith, and more than thirty
belted knights, there remained no memorial in the land “save the orisons
of the monks of Deer.”

Sir Robert de Keith, the influential Marischal of Scotland and staunch
supporter of the Bruce, got a grant of some pleasant lands in the
neighbourhood of the monastery from the King as a reward for his
services. Thereafter, partly through intermarriage, the Marischals in
succession became the leading family in the district, and at the time of
the Reformation were tenants of the abbey lands. By authority of a
member of the family who had become “Abbot and Commendator of Deer,” the
property was by a certain process rather mendaciously made over to the
Earl of the day. But the Earl’s wife, “a woman both of a high spirit and
of tender conscience, forbade her husband to leave such a consuming moth
in his house as was the sacrilegious meddling with the Abisie of Deir.”
Unfortunately, however, “fourteen chalders of meill and beir was a sore
tentatione, and he could not weel indure the randering back of such a
morsell.” Her demand was met with “absolut refusall.” So she had a
vision of the impending ruin of the house. It is thus curiously recorded
by Patrick Gordon, a writer of the eighteenth century, in his book
entitled, _A Short Abridgement of Britanes Distemper from the year of
God 1739 to 1749_.

  The night following, “in her sleepe, she saw a great number of
  religious men in their habit, cum forth of that Abbey to the stronge
  Craige of Dunnoture which is the principall residence of that familie.
  She saw them also sett themselves round about the rock, to gett it
  down and demolishe it, having no instruments nor toilles wherewith to
  perform this work, but only penknyves; wherewith they foolishly (as it
  seemed to her), began to pyk at the Craige. She smyled to sie them
  intend so frutles are interpryse; and went to call her husband to
  scuffe and geyre them out of it. When she had fund him and brought him
  to sie these sillie religious monckes at their foolishe work, behold!
  the wholl Craige, with all his strong and statly buildings, was by
  their penknyves undermynded and fallen in the sea, so as ther remained
  nothing but the wrack of ther rich furniture and stufe flotting on the
  waves of a raging and tempestuous sea. Som of the wiser sort, divining
  upon this vission, attrebute to the penknyves the lenth of time befor
  this should com to pass; and it hath bein observed, by sundrie, that
  the Earles of that house before wer the richest in the kingdom, having
  treasure in store besyd them; but ever since the addition of this so
  great revenue, they have losed their stock by heavie burdeines of debt
  and ingagment.”

The writer who relates this wonderful vision did not live to see the
downfall of the House in the following century, or, it is surmised, he
would have regarded it in the light of a literal fulfilment.

But a much more distinguished author in recent times, the French Comte
de Montalembert, has not hesitated to connect the ruin of the family
fortunes with the sinister “word” of the famous Columcille: “Whosoever
shall come against it, let him not be many-yeared or victorious.” The
scribes who inserted the later entries had kept up the ominous
prediction by concluding the fourth with the sentence, “And the Lord’s
blessing on every mormaer and on every toisech who shall fulfil this,
and to their seed after them;” and the fifth, with the alternative, “And
his blessing on every one who shall fulfil this after him, and his curse
on every one who shall go against it.”

In Gaelic entry No. 2 we suddenly emerge from the traditionary elements
of the first into the region of historical fact. We need not detail the
various grants referred to in the entries 2 to 6 or the names of the
donors. Our chief interest in these vernacular addenda lies in the
circumstance that they throw an ancient and fresh light on the language
and history of the period. Philologically, they are of great value as
the earliest specimens of Scottish Gaelic extant. In Adamnan’s _Life of
St. Columba_ there are, of course, some Celtic words, but these are
merely names of persons or places and the book is the work of a scholar
born and educated in Ireland.

Hitherto, therefore, so far as the Gaelic literary monuments of Scotland
have survived, they may all be regarded as more or less of Irish origin,
character, and inspiration. But here at length and for the first time we
have one that is distinctly Scottish, both in language and the manner of
writing. As Windisch has expressed it in his _Celtic Speeches_, “the
oldest source for Scottish Gaelic is the Book of Deer.” After it there
is no other for 400 years, till the Dean of Lismore’s book is produced
between 1512 and 1526.

Before the sixteenth century you will look in vain for a scrap of any
literature or even record in Scottish Gaelic outside the Book of Deer.
The arguments that may be adduced to show that in the latter we have the
genuine native vernacular, as distinct from the Irish Gaelic in vogue in
contemporary MSS., are these.

First, the book was evolved in a corner of Scotland as remote as could
be from Ireland. The district formed part of the country of the Picts,
who had asserted a kind of independence in ecclesiastical affairs.

Second, the Norsemen by their frequent incursions had inserted a wedge
as it were between the two countries that hitherto had so much in
common. They destroyed Iona and forced the Church to adopt Dunkeld as
its chief abbatial centre. Since Malcolm Canmore’s time, Scotland was
thus becoming a separate kingdom, independent of English and Irish
influences, and the establishment of bishoprics by the Kings Alexander
and David freed even the Church from both England and Ireland. The
twelfth century was therefore a likely time for the birth of a native
literature.

Third, the writing in the Book of Deer is of a thoroughly practical
kind, relating to business transactions, and the Gaelic of the district
must have been used. The very purpose of the memoranda was to
substantiate claims against future mormaers and toisechs who might be
disposed to dispute their legality.

Fourth, it is believed that even in the Western Highlands, not to speak
of Buchan, the difference between Irish and Scottish Gaelic was then
wider than the literature would lead us to infer. For this reason, that
the Gaelic MSS. of the period were produced by men who derived their
culture from Ireland and naturally followed the Irish standard in their
written compositions. The contents of the Book of Deer fully justify
that conclusion.

The Gaelic text is of the same age with that in the Leabhar Na h’Uidhre
and Book of Hymns. Yet a comparison with these typical Irish monuments
shows that the monks of Deer had developed peculiarities in writing
Gaelic which differed considerably from the standard of the Irish
scholars. Windisch, commenting upon this circumstance, says, “The manner
of expression, words, and forms are as in the Irish, but the manner of
writing shows already a stronger phonetic decay; whether it be that the
Scotch Gaelic has lived faster, or that only the manner of writing has
remained less ancient, and has fitted itself more exactly to the
pronunciation of the time.”

It is in this respect more like the Middle than the Ancient Irish.

Those who are interested in the study of archaic words and grammatical
forms will find the Book of Deer not a bad quarry; in fact our very
oldest bed-rock for Scottish idioms. There are few declensional
specimens, it is true, but these suffice to show, as Dr. Whitley Stokes
observed, that the Highlanders declined their nouns in the eleventh
century as fully as the Irish, which is very far from being the case
to-day. Some of the peculiarities of the newly-fledged Scottish Gaelic
may here be noticed. For example, that distinction of vowels so
noticeable in the Authorised Version of the Scriptures, where we have
the Irish _o_ in _focal_ instead of the Scottish _a_ as in _facal_, may
be observed in the colophon of the Book of Deer, where we have
_truagain_, “the poor wretch,” and not _trogan_ as in the Irish Priscian
of St. Gall. Another feature is the confusion of vowels if ending words,
as _i_ for _e_, the sinking of _c_ and _t_ to _g_ and _d_, and the
assimilation of _ld_ and _ln_ to _ll_. The spelling has further local
characteristics, perhaps due to Pictish influence, as, for example, _cc_
for _ch_; thus _imacc_ is for _imach_, modern _a mach_, “out of,”
“henceforth;” _buadacc_ is for _buad(h)ach_, “victorious.”

The aspirated _d_ or _g_ is dropped, as in _blienee_, just as from
Jocelyn of Furness (1180) we learn that the pronunciation of _tighearn_
was at that time _tyern_, though in Irish _tigerna_. Another Gaelic
Scotticism is the manner of treating _n_ in the preposition _in_. In
early Irish the _n_ disappears before _s_ and _p_; here it is retained,
as _insaere_, _inpett_. We also find _ibbidbin_ for _im-bidbin_ and
_ig-ginn_ for _in-cinn_. Thus the two peculiar features of Celtic
grammar known as aspiration and eclipsis, or vocalic infection and nasal
infection of tenues, are observed.

The great rule for spelling known as “Leathan ri leathan is caol ri
caol,” that is, “broad (vowel) to broad, and small (vowel) to small,”
forced on Scottish Gaelic from Ireland, is, with very rare exceptions,
ignored in the Book of Deer. The orthography of the latter has many
contractions, and is more phonetic than that of the Irish MSS. All of
which peculiarities and circumstances point to the conclusion arrived at
by Celtic scholars in general, that the Scottish Gaelic dialect of the
eleventh and the twelfth centuries, and especially the accent, differed
much from the language of educated Irishmen.

The next two literary monuments of this vernacular, namely, those of the
Dean of Lismore and of Duncan Macrae of Inverinate, both of whom wrote
phonetically, bring out this difference between the two dialects still
more clearly. It is an interesting fact, apparent from the Book of Deer,
that the present Aberdeenshire, now so Teutonic, was, when the entries
were made, a Gaelic-speaking district. The names of the kings, mormaers,
and toisechs mentioned are all Celtic, indeed most of them are common
enough names to-day in the Highlands,—Cathal, Domnall, Muridach,
Maelcolum, Cainnech, Donnchad, Gartnait, Aedh, Comgall, Maledoun,
Matadin; Nectan was Bishop of Aberdeen, Leot Abbot of Brechin,
Domangart, a ferlegin or “man of learning,” and Cormac Abbot of Turiff.
A few are non-Celtic, such as Andrew, Samson, and David. Unhappily, in
these records the names of women do not figure much. Two very euphonious
and beautiful ones, however, are given,—Eua, the “wedded wife” of
Colban, and Ete, daughter of Gillemichel. It is a wonder that these
delightful names, especially Ete or Eite, have gone out of use in the
Highlands.

The Celts seem to have had a genius for coining melodious appellations,
sweet and endearing, as well as strong, rough, and uncouth.

Unlike Adamnan’s _Vita Columbæ_ and Bede’s _History_, there is no hint
in this MS. of any language other than Latin and Gaelic. The latter was
in evidence in the Courts of Banff and Aberdeen, and we would gather
from the line of vernacular inserted in the Latin fragment of an Office
for the Visitation of the Sick that the monks of Deer were more familiar
with their Gaelic than their Latin; for in the Irish Book of Dimna the
direction is not the Gaelic “Hisund dubeir sacorfaic dau,” but it is the
Latin “Das ei Eucharistan.”

But apart from their philological value, the memoranda in the Book of
Deer throw a welcome light on an early and obscure period of our
national history. Where the student of the social, political, and
ecclesiastical machinery of the time would otherwise have to grope his
way among dim and doubtful hints and analogies, he has here authentic
glimpses into the Celtic condition of Scotland.

And these notices are all the more valuable because they were made at
the time when a great social and ecclesiastical revolution was
impending. There was, on one side, the change from the primitive
patriarchal polity to the feudal regime, and on the other, from the
monastic to the parochial system. The period covered by the entries is
towards the close of the Celtic epoch, before this momentous transition
had taken place. We see the old order ready to depart, and we get some
light on the origin of the new institutions which were about to
supersede it.

Queen Margaret, wife of Malcolm Canmore, had much to do with the
remoulding of the ancient structure of society in Scotland. This old
system of inherited peculiarity was first confronted with one founded on
different principles, when the Celtic clergy of Scotland met in council,
to listen during three days to the addresses of the Saxon princess,
whose speeches were translated into the language of the Gael by her
husband the King. Just as in the other great social movements of later
times in the Highlands, the influences that undermined the old order
were not the result of natural progress in the Celtic polity, but of
foreign ideas and principles introduced from without. It was these that
led to the destruction of the civil and ecclesiastical institutions on
which the old regime rested. In the train of Queen Margaret had come
into Scotland a race of Saxon, and afterwards of Norman settlers, whose
presence in the country led to a quickening of the national life, and
the awakening of a feeling of unity such as could find no place among
the divided clans of a Celtic people.

In the Book of Deer we still have the old patriarchal system in full
swing. There is the Ardrigh or High King. Under him and over the
provinces are the mormaers, and under the mormaers the tribal or
district chieftains known as toisechs. All these had their exactions out
of the land, besides having their own fat manor lands. They had rights
of personal service, civil and military; of entertainment when
travelling; and of exacting rent in kind or in money. There were neither
dioceses nor parishes as yet. The patriarchal idea was carried out even
in the monastic system. Each tribe or tuath had a monastery. Its abbot
belonged to a leading family of the tuath or of the founder, in which
family the office was hereditary. The system gave rise to great abuses;
for as the monastery grew rich in lands the abbot took to do more with
the temporal than with the spiritual management, and often the lands
passed out of the possession of the monastery altogether into the hands
of the laymen.

“It was not so in the case of Deer, the clerics of which down to the
middle of the twelfth century were still receiving from the bounty of
the Gaelic chiefs of this district additions to their monastic
inheritance, in the whole of which they were secured by King David I.,
with full immunity from all secular exactions.” It is plain, however,
from the terms of the royal charter, that attempts had been made to
fleece them, and that they were able to maintain their rights in virtue
of the grants recorded in their book.

The abuses of the lay abbacies, though not wholly removed, were fairly
checked by Queen Margaret and her sons, through the creation of
bishoprics and the gradual supersession of the monastic by the parochial
system. Soon, dioceses and parishes, which cannot be traced farther back
than the time of Alexander I., began to appear in the records. They had
been established in England much earlier.

Other new civil divisions and distinctions emerge. The old “countries”
and “provinces” become shires. Towns spring up, and the number of
individuals and corporations holding personal property and corporate
rights increased. A large part of the best land was given by charter
from King David to men who held of the crown in feudal tenure.

The mormaer became merged in the Earl, and the toisech in the Thane. In
short, with the growth of feudal law, and the change to the parochial
system, the old Celtic regime was fast becoming a thing of the past,
though many of the customs and traditions associated therewith lingered
on till the great overthrow of the Forty-five, and even in some
localities almost to our own times.

We are thus able, through the medium of this venerable Book of Deer, to
reach a hand over time to Columcille and his faithful Drostan, to Bede
the Pict, to the monks of Buchan, and that succession of the Ardrighs,
mormaers, and toisechs who lived in the old and primitive conditions,
before the new institutions and the regime under which we ourselves
exist were evolved. We can hardly think of Scotland to-day apart from
the categories of parishes, burghs, individual freedom, English
language, and many others, and yet in these far-off times the monks of
Deer and their contemporaries had to be doing without them. For all
this, these men were not lacking in culture or pious devotion. Their
book shows us that they revered the spiritual Columba as their Chief,
and founder of their monastery, and besides being expert caligraphists,
having some skill in painting and illumination, they were educated with
a sufficient knowledge of Latin to transcribe it intelligently and use
it in the services of the church. “This is not much to say of them,”
says Dr. Anderson in his Rhind Lectures, “but,” he adds, “it is a great
deal more than we have it in our power to say of any other community or
institution from similar evidence, if we except the parent community of
Iona itself.”

Of the Gaelic of the Book of Deer there are three editions. The first
was prepared, Latin and Gaelic together, with valuable preface and
facsimile plates, by Dr. Stuart, and published by the Spalding Club in
1869. It is one of the many excellent and beautifully printed volumes we
owe to that distinguished Association. Mr. Stokes was responsible for
the English translation. The second publication he has given himself, in
his own _Goidelica_. There we find all the later entries of the codex
with translation, notes, and glossary. A similar service has since been
rendered by Dr. Macbain of Inverness, who provides the text with
translation, notes, and glossary of his own, founded on the work of the
previous editors, but throwing additional light on the vocabulary. This
contribution appears in the eleventh volume of the _Transactions of the
Gaelic Society of Inverness_ (1884–85), and is a welcome aid to the
study of the text.

As in the case of the oldest book of Scotland, so in the case of this
second oldest, it is to be regretted that the Book of Deer has strayed
outwith our own land, yet no doubt, it is to this fact that we owe the
existence of both to-day; for no other book of so ancient a calibre has
been able to survive the many stormy convulsions and turbulent ferments
known as Scottish history. Cast up like flotsam and jetsam in a late
age, and treasured in the high places of learning, they both add a
lustre and a glory now to our ancient language and literature which we
would otherwise in vain desiderate.




                               CHAPTER VI

      texts—Unexpected light—H. d’Arbois de Jubainville and his mission

      Masters”—Romance of the fugitive documents.


It is practically within the last fifty years that the great revival in
the study of Celtic literature has taken place. About the middle of last
century the foremost scholars began to arrive, and since then there has
been quite a galaxy of experts, both on the Continent and in the British
Isles, who have approached the subject on scientific lines, and by
careful literary research have not only opened to us the treasures of
the past, but have also thrown a flood of light on them.

Prior to their advent, Celtic studies had no solid basis, for the
sufficient reason that the materials were not available. Old-time
convulsions had dispersed the documents to the four winds, and they
remained where they lay, buried for ages from the public eye.

Such learned men as occupied themselves with these studies before the
middle of last century confined their attention in great part to the
languages and literatures of the Neo-Celtic races—the Welsh and the
Bretons. They sought in these light to dissipate the obscurity that hung
over the early history of the Celtic race—the period anterior to the
conquest of Gaul by the Romans. They consulted grammars and dictionaries
published in Brittany, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, during the last
three centuries. Of the texts themselves, the oldest they knew were
Welsh, dating from about the thirteenth century; and some poems of Welsh
bards preserved in MSS., of which the most ancient went no farther back
than the end of the twelfth century. These were literary treasures
indeed, with the characteristic Celtic flavour, as may be seen from the
beautiful critiques of Renan and Matthew Arnold, both of whom were
charmed by the spirit and sentiment they breathe.

But in general it may be said that the early scholars had only mastered
the more modern forms of the language, and it was from texts
comparatively recent that they sought illumination of a past removed
from them by more than nineteen centuries.

Such was the stage Celtic study had reached—a kind of arrested
development—when suddenly a unique resuscitation took place.

The first of the new scholars to arrive were O’Donovan and O’Curry.
Eugene O’Curry, Professor of the Catholic University of Ireland, went
straight to the necessities of the case by publishing in 1849 a
catalogue of the Gaelic MSS. in the British Museum, and then, of those
in the Royal Academy of his native land. Afterwards, besides other
valuable contributions, he gave to the world his _Lectures on the MS.
Materials of Irish History_, enhancing the interest of the work by
putting a very large and varied selection of facsimiles of the ancient
writings in the appendix. A very Tischendorf was this indefatigable MS.
hunter and interpreter. Very aptly indeed did he speak of himself as an
underground worker. Much had been done by other labourers, but the
foundation was still to seek and still to lay. And it is significant of
former methods, that he knew not one man previous to his own time who
had qualified himself for the work in hand, either by mastering the
ancient Gaelic, or by making himself acquainted with the MSS. And yet
these are the genuine sources of historical and antiquarian knowledge in
this department.

Close after O’Curry came the great Continental savant Zeuss, who may be
regarded as the real founder of the new and solid basis on which Celtic
studies now rest. His monumental work, the erudite _Grammatica Celtica_,
appeared in Leipzig in 1853, giving a new impetus all over Europe to a
study which hitherto had attracted but a languid, or at the best, a
restricted attention. And when, following up this great work, the German
grammarian published the glosses found in some of the oldest Gaelic MSS.
on the Continent, it was recognised that he had opened up a new and most
fertile field for future explorers. These latter were immediately
forthcoming—learned authorities, like Nigra, Ascoli, Ebel, Stokes,
Windisch, and Zimmer, who brought to light other important documents and
explained their significance. Thus was the new movement in Celtic study
duly inaugurated, with what results we shall see.

The glosses published by Zeuss, though they furnish no fresh ideas,
offer to the learned world a grammatical interest of the highest kind.
They belong, some to the eighth century, others to the ninth, and the
venerable Gaelic in which they are couched presents certain antique and
curious characteristics which are entirely lacking to the Welsh of the
same period, and still more to that of the twelfth and following
centuries—the only forms known to the scholars before Zeuss.

Since his time the new basis which he found for Celtic studies has been
wonderfully enlarged, chiefly through the discovery of other Gaelic
texts contemporary with some of those that served for his own beautiful
work. And then the remarkable publications of erudite men in Dublin, and
the excellent work of Windisch, Professor of Sanskrit at Leipzig, have
called the attention of experts on the continent to a great mass of
documentary material in the British Isles. Under the transcription and
retouching of many of these MSS. by later copyists, there are found
original compositions, primarily in the ancient Gaelic of which Zeuss
was the first interpreter.

Unlike the glosses, they furnish us with a vast storehouse of new ideas
and traditions of every sort, comprising especially the mythological and
legendary, the legal also, and even the grammatical under various forms.
Their originality is unquestionable. These texts, in carrying us back to
pagan times, throw quite unexpected light on the incomplete though
precious accounts which ancient writers like Cæsar, Diodorus of Sicily,
and Strabo have given of the primitive civilisation of the Gauls. We
should expect to find in this mass of curious heroic literature some
expression of the traditions common to all the Celtic race before the
settlement of the different branches in the countries which now bear
their name, and we are not disappointed. The MSS. preserved do give us a
crowd of fresh thoughts on the beliefs and customs of the Celts in the
most ancient epochs of their history.

In this respect they help to gratify the longing desire of living men to
know something of the actions, the range of thought, the character of
mind, the habits, the tastes, the arts, the religion, and, in short, the
everyday life of so old and venerable a race as our own, which has
played such a wonderful part in the drama of history.

The French authorities have been fully alive to the value of these
studies, and on one occasion, at least, the Minister of Public
Instruction showed his interest in a very practical and laudable way. In
February of 1881 Jules Ferry, who was in office at the time, appointed
H. d’Arbois de Jubainville, Professor of Celtic in the College of
France, as a special commissioner to visit the British Isles, and
investigate and make a list of all the Gaelic MSS. he could find. This
literary mission De Jubainville carried out the same year, subsequently
embodying his report in a book which gives not only his catalogue of
MSS. inspected in England and Ireland, but also a list of those on the
Continent. For some reason or other he omitted to include Scotland in
the area of his research, and so the large collection of valuable
documents in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, is not chronicled in his
interesting résumé. Yet still, we have now for the first time a pretty
general estimate of all the more important material available.

We need not follow this enthusiastic MS. hunter in his peregrinations
through the British Isles and on the Continent, entering, as he
frequently did, the precincts of ancient universities, cloisters, and
museums, sitting in odd corners in libraries, poring over musty leaves,
deciphering antique characters, looking at some documents through glass
cases which he would fain see opened, handling others with eager,
hurried scrutiny, while a verger or a monk mounts sentry over the
inquisitive foreigner, watching the precious relics with jealous care,
and limiting the time for observation.

What concerns us most are the tabulated results; and we might look in
the passing at some of the more striking facts which they exhibit.

And first of all it is not a little surprising to learn that, while the
libraries of the Continent possess twenty MSS., or more correctly twenty
portions of MSS., written in the Gaelic language before the eleventh
century, in the libraries of England and Ireland there are only seven of
that remote age. But after that date the British libraries take the
lead, since the number of their Gaelic MSS. before the seventeenth
century amount to 133, whereas the total on the Continent down to the
seventeenth century is only thirty-five. Of course this excludes the
Celtic Latin MSS., of which there are upwards of 200 in European
libraries.

Altogether there are just fifty-six Gaelic documents that are known to
be on the Continent of dates ranging from the eighth to the nineteenth
century, and these are distributed as follows:—

 8th century           2 Milan, Cambray.
 8th to 9th century    2 St. Paul in Carinthia, Vienna.
 9th century          13 Berne, Carlsruhe (2), Dresden, Laon, Leyden,
                           Nancy, Paris (2), Rome, St. Gall (2), Turin.
 9th to 10th century   1 Würzburg.
 10th century          2 Paris.
 11th century          6 Carlsruhe, Rome (2), St. Gall, Vienna (2).
 11th to 12th century  1 Klosterneuburg.
 12th century          1 Engelberg.
 13th to 15th century  1 Rennes.
 14th to 16th century  1 Paris.
 16th century          1 Stockholm.
 17th century         12 Brussels (11), Paris.
 18th century          5 Paris (4), Rouen.
 19th century          4 Paris (2), Rouen (2).
 Dates uncertain       4 Berne, Florence, Milan (2).

Besides the number, antiquity, and wide distribution of these MSS., we
are struck with two things. First, the fact that Milan and Cambray, two
Continental cities, have the honour of possessing the two most ancient
Gaelic MSS. now extant. One of these relics is a Latin commentary on the
Psalms, the other a Latin sermon, but in both there are glosses in Irish
or Gaelic written in the eighth century. Earlier than that we cannot go
for actual writing still extant in the native tongue.

The other striking thing about the list is the entire absence of Gaelic
MSS. in the northern countries of Europe, such as Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark, where we should most expect to find them. There is one indeed
at Stockholm, but it is merely a copy written in the sixteenth century.
Surely this goes far to confirm the sinister reputation of the marauding
Danes and Norsemen with regard to learning. Keating, writing 250 years
ago, asserts their destructiveness. “It was not allowed to give
instruction in letters.... No scholars, no clerics, no books, no holy
relics, were left in church or monastery through dread of them. Neither
bard nor philosopher nor musician pursued his wonted profession in the
land.”

Apparently these northern pillagers, who laid waste so many monasteries,
instead of removing the rare and precious books to their own lands, were
no better than the Vandals in their mad business of burning and
destroying on the spot what they evidently themselves could not value or
appreciate.

But coming now to the British Isles, we might briefly consider the
literary legacy which the learned Frenchman found in those libraries of
England and Ireland that he visited. In all, he mentions 953 as the
number of MSS. to which he had access, and these were located as
follows:—

                     At Cambridge                 3
                     „  British Museum          166
                     „  Oxford                   15
                     „  Royal Irish Academy     560
                     „  Trinity College, Dublin  63
                     „  Franciscans, Dublin      22
                     „  Lord Ashburnham          63
                     „  Some special libraries   61
                                                ———
                        Total                   953
                                                ===

So far from being exhaustive, our literary commissioner thinks these
figures very far below the actual number of Gaelic MSS. in the British
Isles. Though he makes no reference in this respect to Wales or
Scotland, he is aware that there must be many in private libraries that
he has not indicated. And he admits that, according to O’Curry, Trinity
College has 140 instead of the 63 he mentions. And besides its 559
catalogued MSS., the Royal Academy of Ireland possesses about as many
more not catalogued, of which only one, the Book of Fermoy, was
described to him as worthy of his special attention.

Though in point of antiquity there is none of all these British MSS. to
compare with the oldest glosses on the Continent, there are two which
come near it. They date from the ninth century, and are both located in
Trinity College. These are the Book of Armagh and the Book of Dimna.
Next in order, between the ninth and tenth centuries, come (1) the Irish
Canons at Cambridge; (2) the Gospel of Maeielbrid Mac Durnâin, tenth
century, at Lambeth Palace; (3) the Psalter of Southampton, end of the
tenth century or beginning of the eleventh, at St. John’s College,
Cambridge; (4) The Book of Deer, with its Latin, ninth to tenth, and
Gaelic entries tenth to twelfth, also at Cambridge in the University
Library; and (5) the Gaelic portion of the Missal of Stowe, bought by
the British Government with the rest of Lord Ashburnham’s collection for
their Museum.

These seven MSS. are the most ancient, the only ones, in fact, in which
you find Gaelic written before the eleventh century within the British
Isles. Yet they are not Gaelic MSS., strictly speaking, but Latin ones
in which are found some words or phrases or paragraphs written in the
native tongue. The Gospel of Maeielbrid, for example, contains only a
line and a half of Gaelic, the Book of Armagh four pages.

To find what we would strictly call Gaelic documents, we must come down
as far as the closing years of the eleventh century, which yields us
four. Henceforth there is no lack of abundant and rich material. The
twelfth century is credited with seven, the thirteenth with eight, the
fourteenth with eleven, the fifteenth and sixteenth with ninety-six, the
seventeenth with sixty-six, the first half of the eighteenth with
seventy-seven. Total down to the year 1750, 276 MSS. in the British
Isles of the whole number 953 catalogued by De Jubainville. So that the
remainder, the vast majority of the British MSS., are of comparatively
recent date, subsequent in fact even to the days of Macpherson of
Ossianic fame.

More important than the number, dates, and distribution is the
subject-matter of our literary legacy, and this now falls to be
considered. It is very difficult to classify the MSS. according to their
contents, as so many of them are miscellaneous. Yet they do admit of
being brought under certain categories. Leaving aside for the present
all the later ones written after 1600, we have in all 168 Continental
and British documents to deal with.

Of these we must place in a section apart all the Latin ones that only
contain glosses or poems or notes in Gaelic which are additional or
secondary to the original text. This is the case with all the
Continental MSS. concerned, except three, one at Rennes, one at Paris,
and one at Stockholm. It is also the case with ten Britishers, viz. (1)
the Book of Deer, (2) the Irish Canons, (3) the Psalter at Cambridge,
(4) the Gospel of Maelbrigte hua Maelûanaig, (5) the Book of Dimna, (6)
the Book of Armagh, (7) the Book of Kells, (8) the fragment of Psalter
attributed to St. Camin, (9) the Missal of Stowe, and (10) the Gospel of
Maeielbrid Mac Durnâin at Lambeth Palace.

That makes a total of forty-two in which the Gaelic is only added in
notes to a Latin original. Yet they comprise the most ancient of all we
have, and though their grammatical value is very considerable, their
literary interest is but meagre—almost nil in fact—with the exception of
the few poems at Milan, St. Gall, Dresden, St. Paul in Carinthia, and
Klosterneuburg.

As these poems seem to lie like wayside flowers in our path, it is worth
our while, before passing on, to turn aside for a little to cull some of
the verses.

Of the two poems in the Milan codex, Dr. Stokes declares they are
difficult to decipher and more difficult to translate. But of the four
quatrains on the margin of the Priscian of St Gall, here are two
charming examples, very characteristic of the Gael’s love of nature and
learning, as well as reminiscent of his wild environment. The first is
not unlike the lyric of Columcille himself, when he describes the peace
of Durrow:—

                     A grove surrounds me:
           The swift lay of the blackbird makes music to me—
                 I will not hide it;
           Over my much-lined little book,
             The song of the birds makes music to me.

The author of the second, as Professor Mackinnon has fancied, must often
have seen the storm burst upon a wild spot on the west of Ireland, or,
more likely still, on Iona, Tiree, Oronsay, or Skye.

                   Is acher in gaith innocht:
                   Tufuasna fairggae findfholt;
                   Ni ágor reimm mora minn
                   Dond laechraid lainn oa Lochlind.

                   Wild blows the wind to-night:
                   The white-haired billows rage;
                   The bold warriors from Norway
                   Fear not the path of a clear sea.

In the Codex Boernerianus of Dresden we have the following lines.
Translated literally, they run thus:—

  To go to Rome is much of trouble, little of profit. The King whom thou
  seekest here, unless thou bring him with thee thou findest not.

  Great folly, great madness, great loss of sense, great folly since
  thou hast proposed (?) to go to death, to be under the unwill of
  Mary’s Son.

It was the late Herr Mone, Archivdirektor at Carlsruhe, who discovered
the Gaelic poems in the MS. belonging to St. Paul in Carinthia, and sent
the first verse of the first of these poems to Dr. Reeves. Thereafter
Dr. Whitley Stokes wrote him requesting to be favoured with the
remainder, with which request he not only complied, but also sent two
other extracts from the same codex, and a letter dated Carlsruhe,
January 24th, 1859. There are in all five short Gaelic poems or
fragments in the MS.

The first, of eight stanzas, is in praise of Aedh, son of Diarmad, and
has been translated by Eugene O’Curry.

We give here simply the first and last verses:—

             Aedh great to institute hilarity,
             Aedh anxious (desirous) to dispense festivity,
             The Straight Rod, the most beautiful,
             Of the hills of cleared Ro-er-enn.

             At ale-drinking, poems are sung
             By companies among people’s houses
             Sweet-singing bards announce
             In pools of ale the name of Aedh.

The next to be quoted is part of a longer poem found in the Books of
Leinster, Ballymote, Glendaloch, Lismore, and a Bodleian MS. The copy
from the Book of Leinster is given in full by Dr. Whitley Stokes in his
_Goidelica_, but here are the two quatrains of it in the Carinthian
codex:—

             He is a bird round which a trap shuts,
             He is a leaky bark in dangerous peril,
             He is an empty vessel, he is a withered tree,
             Who so doth not the will of the King above.

             He is pure gold, he is a heaven round the sun,
             He is a vessel of silver full of wine,
             He is an angel, he is wisdom of saints,
             Every one who doth the will of the King.

The third poem, Dr. Stokes says, is exceedingly obscure. It seems to
mean—

  There remains a fort in Tuain Inbir ... with its stars last night,
  with its sun, with its moon.

  Gobhan made that: let its story be perceived by you: my heartlet, God
  of heaven, he is the thatcher that thatched it.

  A house wherein thou gettest not moisture; a place wherein thou
  fearest not spear-points. More radiant it is than a garden, and it
  without an _udnacht_ around it.

Another of the pieces in this Carinthian MS. is of a very different
order. A monk in a humorous and facetious strain, according to Professor
Zimmer, contrasts his own serious studies with the very different
pursuits of another person whom he calls Pan Gurban (or Panqur ban,
Windisch), a Slavonic name, meaning, as Zimmer thinks, “Mr. Hunchback.”

Omitting the forty-two Gaelic documents from the 168, we have 126
remaining which have been written before the year 1600, and these deal
with a great variety of subjects: religion, law, medicine, astronomy,
grammar, history, and legendary history.

The texts that treat of theology, mysticism, lives of saints, and
martyrologies, are very numerous; those of law few. Medicine figures in
a class apart. Astronomy gets even a smaller place than medicine. Its
most ancient monument dates from the fourteenth century.

One of the most curious and least known of all the Gaelic relics is a
treatise on Gaelic grammar, written in Gaelic. It is divided into four
books, and is preserved to us in ten MSS. of the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and sixteenth centuries. The four books of which it is composed are
attributed, the first to Cennfaelad, an historic personage who died in
678; the other three to mythical, prehistoric authors, such as
Fercertné, Amergin Glûngel, and Fenius Farsaid. The antiquity and
ability of the latter grammarian for the work, may be inferred from the
somewhat startling statement that he is said to have composed the Gaelic
tongue out of seventy-two languages, and afterwards his son Nial visited
Egypt to teach the languages after the confusion of Babel. Verily the
Celts were an enterprising race to have a grammarian first in the field,
and the nebulous Fenius Farsaid deserves a grave as high as Browning’s
hero, for even before Moses “ground he at grammar.” It is a pity that
this rare old treatise which Ireland possessed in the Middle Ages has
not been published. The MSS. are in the British Museum, Royal Academy of
Ireland, Trinity College, and with the Franciscans of Dublin.

But not in any of the above-named categories do we find the body and
soul of Celtic literature. The real breathing spirit of the past speaks
to us rather in the great MSS. of the Middle Ages, those which deal with
romance and history—the earlier sagas and the later annals; and these
deserve more than a passing reference. The saga or heroic literature is
far and away the most curious and abundant. De Jubainville himself
chronicles no less than 540 pieces of this class. But its greatest
monuments are the miscellaneous MSS. known as the Leabhar Na h’Uidhre,
the Book of Leinster, Book of Ballymote, Book of Lecain, and Book of
Lismore.

No more precious and important document in the whole range of ancient
Gaelic literature has reached us than the Leabhar Na h’Uidhre, or Book
of the Dun Cow, said to be so called after an original text of that name
now lost, but of which it contains a copy. St. Ciaran, it appears, wrote
down from the dictation of the risen Fergus, the tale of the “Táin Bó
Chuailgné,” in a book which he had made from the hide of his pet cow.
This favourite from its colour was called the Odhar (or Dun), of which
Na h’Uidhre is the genitive. The existing Leabhar Na h’Uidhre is a MS.
of the end of the eleventh century, and, even more than the Book of
Hymns, its contemporary, it merits the distinction of being the earliest
exclusively Gaelic document that we have. Besides preserving St.
Ciaran’s version of the Táin, it contains a copy of Dallan Forgaill’s
famous “Amra” in praise of Columcille, and quite a number of ancient
sacred and secular pieces, some of which are of great interest. The
compiler of this venerable codex was Maelmuiri, son of the son of Conn
nam-Bocht, a writer who met his death in 1106 in the middle of the great
stone church of Clonmacnois, at the hands of a band of robbers. There is
a quaint inscription at the top of folio 45 in his own original
handwriting. The words run, “This is a trial of his pen here by
Maelmuiri, son of the son of Conn.”

Next in importance to Leabhar Na h’Uidhre comes the Book of Leinster,
written fifty years later. Rich in saga, it contains the fullest account
of the “Táin Bó Chuailgné.” O’Curry sets so high a value upon this codex
that he writes: “I think I may say with sorrow that there is not in all
Europe any nation but this of ours that would not long since have made a
national literary fortune out of such a volume, had any other country in
Europe been fortunate enough to possess such an heirloom of history.”

The Book of Ballymote belongs to the end of the fourteenth century—that
of Lismore to the fifteenth. The latter is the property of the Duke of
Devonshire, having been discovered in his Castle of Lismore, county of
Waterford, Ireland, so late as the year 1814. Besides containing Lives
of saints, etc., it is considered specially important in point of view
of the Ossianic cycle.

Of all the heroic sagas the greatest and the longest is that for which
we are indebted to the Book of Leinster and Leabhar Na h’Uidhre—the
“Táin Bó Chuailgné.” This is not the place to deal with such a lengthy
story; but by way of illustrating the quality and literary interest of
these old world MSS., preserving as they do the most characteristic
traits of Celtic genius in the age before writing, we give two
quotations from this wonderful saga.

And the first will show the keen perception, the wealth of pictorial
detail, and descriptive power of language so characteristic of the
Gaelic ursgeuls and poems. It is the personal account of the Ulster
chiefs as given in the Táin.

  “There came another company there,” said Mac Roth; “no champion could
  be found more comely than he who leads them. His hair is of a deep-red
  yellow, and bushy; his forehead broad and his face tapering; thin red
  lips; pearly shining teeth; a white smooth body. A red and white cloak
  flutters about him; a golden brooch in that cloak at his breast; a
  shirt of white kingly linen with gold embroidery at his skin; a white
  shield with gold fastenings at his shoulder; a gold-hilted long sword
  at his left side; a long, sharp, dark-green spear with a rich band and
  carved silver rivets in his hand.” “Who is he, O Fergus?” said Ailill.
  “The man who has come there is in himself half a battle; the fury of
  the slaughter hound,” etc.

Truly a wonderful accoutred warrior was this, and gorgeous in his
apparel for his age. Like our Oriental Nabobs and savage chiefs he
believed in colour and luxurious display.

But I fancy it would be hard to beat the second quotation as an
illustration of the riotous luxuriance of the Celtic imagination in the
days when it was at its best, unsobered by science, unrestricted by
reason. The quotation is from the description of the fight between the
two rival bulls in Queen Meve’s country. In the poetic language of the
tale, “the province rang with the echoes of their roaring, the sky was
darkened by the sods of earth they threw up with their feet, and the
foam that flew from their mouths; faint-hearted men, women, and children
hid themselves in caves, caverns, and clefts of the rocks, whilst even
the most veteran warriors but dared to view the combat from the
neighbouring hills and eminences. The Finn-bheannach or White-horned at
length gave way, and retreated towards a certain pass which opened into
the plain in which the battle raged, and where sixteen warriors bolder
than the rest had planted themselves; but so rapid was the retreat and
the pursuit that not only were all these trampled to the ground, but
they were buried several feet in it. The Donn Chuailgne at last coming
up with his opponent, raised him on his horns, ran off with him, passed
the gates of Meve’s palace, tossing and shaking him as he went, until at
last he shattered him to pieces, dropping his disjointed members as he
went along. And wherever a part fell, that place retained the name of
that joint ever after.” And thus it was that “Ath Luain, now Athlone,
which was before called Ath Mor or the Great Ford, received its present
name from the Finnbheannach’s luan or loin having been dropped there.”

This “Táin Bó Chuailgné” opens a window upon the past, and were it only
for the rich and abundant historical details it so lavishly furnishes,
must be held a treasure. “Notwithstanding the extreme wildness of the
legend,” says O’Curry, “I am not acquainted with any tale in the whole
range of our literature in which the student will find more of valuable
details concerning general and local history; more of description of the
manners and customs of the people; of the druidical and fairy influence
supposed to be exercised in the affairs of men; of the laws of Irish
chivalry and honour; of the standards of beauty, morality, valour,
truth, and fidelity exercised by the people of old; of the regal power
and dignity of the monarch and the provincial kings, as well as much
concerning the division of the country into its local dependencies;
lists of its chieftains and chieftaincies; many valuable topographical
names; the names and kinds of articles of dress and ornament; of
military weapons; of horses, chariots, and trappings; of leechcraft as
well as instances of perhaps every occurrence that could be supposed to
happen in ancient Irish life. All of these details are of the utmost
value to the student of history, even though mixed up with any amount of
the marvellous or incredible in poetical traditions.”

So much for the sagas and monuments of heroic literature. There remain
the other great class of MSS. to which we have referred—the Annals. They
serve as a basis for Irish history, and only the more quaint and
important need be mentioned here, such as the Annals of Tighernach, the
_Chronicon Scotorum_, the Annals of Innisfallen, the Annals of Boyle,
the Annals of Ulster, the Annals of Loch Cé, the Annals of Clonmacnois,
and most important of all, the book called the “Four Masters.”

Of all these the Annals of Tighernach is the most ancient and most
reliable, having for author the abbot of that name who died in 1088. It
is supposed that in compiling this work he had as basis a chronicle kept
by the monks from the founding of the abbey in 544. The MS. of this
history belongs to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A considerable
part of it is in Gaelic, interspersed with numerous quotations from
Latin and Greek authors. Dr. O’Conor, commenting on this, remarks that
Tighernach’s balancing of these authorities against each other manifests
a degree of criticism uncommon in the early age in which he lived.

The precious historical composition known as the _Chronicon Scotorum_
exists in a copy written towards 1650 by Duald Mac Firbis. The original
belonged to the twelfth century, the chronicle itself ending in 1135. It
begins with the following title and short preface by the compiler:—

  The chronicle of the Scots (or Irish) begins here—

  Understand, O Reader, that it is for a certain reason, and
  particularly to avoid tediousness that our intention is to make only a
  short abstract and compendium of the history of the Scots in this
  book, omitting the lengthened details of the historical books;
  wherefore it is that we beg of you not to criticise us on that account
  as we know that it is an exceedingly great deficiency.

He then passes rapidly over the first three ages of the world,—the
earlier colonisation of Ireland, the death of the colonists at Tallaght
in the county of Dublin, and the visit of Nial, the son of Fenius
Farsaid, to Egypt to teach the languages. With winged speed the compiler
reaches the year 375, when St. Patrick was born, and then the red letter
date 432 which witnessed his arrival in Ireland. Columcille’s prayer at
the battle of Cooldrevna is given under the year 561, and numerous
scraps of poems here and there quoted as authorities. A large deficiency
occurs between 722 and 805 A.D., where the compiler has written, “The
breasts (or fronts) of two leaves of the old book out of which I write
this, are wanting here, and I leave what is before me of this page for
them, I am, Dubhaltach Firbisigh.” A similar defect, it may be noted,
occurs in the Annals of Tighernach from 756 to 973.

The other Annals above-mentioned carry the history down towards the end
of the sixteenth century.

Almost contemporary with the _Chronicon Scotorum_ arose the greatest of
all, _The Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters_,
commonly cited as the “Four Masters,” a name given to its authors by
Colgan. It was the work of Michael O’Clery and other three great
scholars, begun in 1632 and finished in 1636. All the best and most
copious Annals he could find throughout Ireland were collected by him
for this _magnum opus_. Like so many others of these historical
compilations, it begins far back, in the year of the world 2242, and
finishes in 1616 A.D. “There is no event of Irish history,” says Dr.
Hyde, “from the birth of Christ to the beginning of the seventeenth
century, that the first inquiry of the student will not be, ‘What do the
“Four Masters” say about it?’ for the great value of the work consists
in this, that we have here in condensed form the pith and substance of
the old books of Ireland which were then in existence, but which, as the
Four Masters anticipated, have long since perished.”

The work has been published by O’Donovan in 1851. His is regarded as the
best and most complete edition in translation and notes. It forms six
volumes, without counting the supplementary index. The autograph MS.
still exists, composed of two volumes, of which the first, stopping at
the year 1169, forms No. XXI. of the Stowe Collection. Of the second
volume there are two autograph copies: the one complete, in the library
of the Royal Academy of Ireland; the other, comprising only the years
1335 to 1605, is preserved at Trinity College, Dublin.

And now looking back over this long legacy of vellum, is there not
something eerie in the thought of these old-world musty MSS. creeping
out once more into the light, after ages of gravelike oblivion?

If we could follow their actual history, from their slow genesis under
the pen of ancient amanuenses through their subsequent fortunes, when
perhaps some of them under the cloak of a fleeing monk, or in a shaky
coracle at sea, barely escaped the fury of illiterate warriors or the
waves; some of them other perils on land in their wanderings through the
British Isles and the Continent,—what a revelation of life and destiny
that would be! They have slept a long sleep through turbulent ages since
then, apparently unappreciated, buried, neglected, and forgotten, but
now in this new age, as we have seen, there is a mighty hunt and
scramble for the resurrected relics. Many of them have been already
published, and there is a movement afoot by the Irish Text Society to
print the more important of the rest. Libraries and individuals compete
with each other for possession of the originals. So that now, in the
eyes of the wise and the wealthy, the hitherto obsolete MSS., often cast
aside in odd chests and closets as mere brown rubbish, are more prized
and coveted as rare treasure than even their rivals of to-day. And what
a legacy of vellum all-told we owe to the old scribes of cell and
cloister; from the legended Fenius Farsaid all the way down to the “Four
Masters.”
