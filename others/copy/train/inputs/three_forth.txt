                  My delight it was to rise
                  With the early morning skies
                            All aglow,
                  And to brush the dewy height
                  Where the deer in airy state
                            Wont to go;
                  At least a hundred brace
                  Of the lofty antlered race,
                  When they left their sleeping place
                            Light and gay;
                  When they stood in trim array,
                  And with low deep-breasted cry,
                  Flung their breath into the sky,
                            From the brae;
                  When the hind, the pretty fool,
                  Would be rolling in the pool
                            At her will;
                  Or the stag in gallant pride,
                  Would be strutting at the side
                  Of his haughty-headed bride
                            On the hill.
                  And sweeter to my ear
                  Is the concert of the deer
                            In their roaring,
                  Than when Erin from her lyre
                  Warmest strains of Celtic fire
                            May be pouring;
                  And no organ sends a roll
                  So delightsome to my soul,
                  As the branchy-crested race,
                  When they quicken their proud pace,
                  And bellow in the face
                            Of Ben Dorain.
                  O what joy to view the stag
                  When he rises ’neath the crag,
                  And from depth of hollow chest,
                  Sends his bell across the waste,
                  While he tosses high his crest,
                            Proudly scorning.
                  And from milder throat the hind,
                  Lows an answer to his mind
                  With the younglings of her kind
                            In the morning;
                  With her vivid swelling eye,
                  While her antlered lord is nigh,
                  She sweeps both earth and sky,
                            Far away;
                  And beneath her eye-brow grey,
                  Lifts her lid to greet the day,
                  And to guide her turfy way
                            O’er the brae.
                  O how lightsome is her tread,
                  When she gaily goes ahead,
                  O’er the green and mossy bed
                            Of the rills;
                  When she leaps with such a grace
                  You will own her pretty pace
                  Ne’er was hindmost in the race,
                            When she wills;
                  Or when with sudden start,
                  She defies the hunter’s art.
                  And is vanished like a dart
                            O’er the hills.

At the end of the book Mackenzie gives a select number of “Beauties” by
individuals who invoked the muse only on rare occasions, or whose
history is little known to the world. Among these we find the anonymous
yet exquisitely beautiful and pathetic “Mali Bheag Òg.” Our author
claims to be the first to give the whole of it correctly in print.[40]
There is much uncertainty as to the history, circumstance, and locality,
but the occasion of the poem was the elopement of two lovers, who were
pursued. The gallant, a young officer, stood to the defence of his
beautiful fiancée, who stole behind him in the melée. Unhappily his
sword accidentally in the swing struck her so violent a blow that she
expired at his feet. It was in jail awaiting execution that he composed
this heart-melting song:—

               Nach truagh leat mi’s mi’m priosan,
               Mo Mhàli bheag òg
               Do chairdean a’ cuir binn’ orm,
               Mo chuid de’n t-saoghal thù.
               A bhean na mala mìne,
               ’S na’m pogan mar na fiòguis,
               ’S tu nach fagadh shios mi
               Le mi-rùin do bheoil.

               ’S mise bh’air mo bhuaireadh
               Mo Mhàli bheag òg,
               ’Nuair ’thain an ’sluagh mu’n cuairt duinn
               Mo ribhinn ghlan ùr;
               ’S truagh nach ann san uair ud,
               A thuit mo lamh o m’ ghualainn,
               Mu’n dh’amais mi do bhualadh,
               Mo Mhàli bheag òg.

As another independent gleaning, and valuable supplement to Mackenzie’s
work, there falls to be mentioned Archibald Sinclair’s _An T’
Oranaiche_, or the _Gaelic Songster_, published in 1879. “If a man were
permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make the
laws of a nation,” said a wise man. And certainly the songs occupy no
mean place in Celtic life and poetry. Of these there is no collection in
Gaelic like Sinclair’s—humorous, patriotic, satiric, and sentimental. He
gleaned, as he tells us, in many a field, saving some from oblivion.
Others he snatched from fugitive pieces of paper, ere these latter
became food for the moth. In all there are 290 songs in the volume, and
upwards of fifty names of composers, some of whom are still living. The
songs are mainly of last century, and were compiled in Glasgow by their
editor, who was a publisher in that city.

By the well-known gleaners above mentioned, the heroic ballads, the
lyric poems, and the songs have been securely garnered. But there still
remained one large section of the field from which hitherto there had
been no great ingathering, necessary to complete the harvest up to our
time. And happily, ere the century closed, the crowning work appeared.
It is a remarkable book and sumptuous, published in two volumes, in
1900, by Alexander Carmichael, who was for many years a member of Her
Majesty’s Inland Revenue staff, and an enthusiastic admirer of Gaelic
lore. The work is styled “_Carmina Gadelica_,—hymns and incantations,
with illustrative notes on words, rites, and customs, dying and
obsolete; orally collected in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and
translated into English,” by the author. Undoubtedly it places the
compiler in the very front rank of Celtic gleaners, and will carry its
testimony forward to posterity, as a monument of a phase of thought and
life now passing away. Even already its weird and old-world “ortha,
urnan agus ubagan,” sound like the echoes of a far-off time, from which
the race has long since emerged.

Yet its cultured author tells us that this work consists of old lore
collected during the last forty-four years, forming but a small part of
a large mass of oral literature written down from the recital of men and
women throughout the land of the Gael, from Arran to Caithness, and from
Perth to St. Kilda. The greater portion, however, was made in the
Western Isles, the last refuge of the distinctive Celtic life “expiring
on the horizon before the growing tumult of uniform civilisation.”

For three centuries Gaelic oral literature has been disappearing, and,
as our author tells us, it is now becoming meagre in quantity, inferior
in quality, and greatly isolated.

“Several causes have contributed towards this decadence,” he says,
“principally the Reformation, the rebellions, the evictions, the
Disruption, the schools, and the spirit of the age. Converts in
religion, in politics, or in aught else are apt to be intemperate in
speech and rash in action. The Reformation movement condemned the
beliefs and cults tolerated and assimilated by the Celtic Church and the
Latin Church. Nor did sculpture and architecture escape their
intemperate zeal. The rebellions harried and harassed the people, while
the evictions impoverished, dispirited, and scattered them over the
world. Ignorant school teaching and clerical narrowness have been
painfully detrimental to the expressive language, wholesome literature,
manly sports, and interesting amusements of the Highland people.”

Mr. Carmichael has classified the contents of his extensive gleaning
under the following five sub-titles: Invocations, Seasons, Labour,
Incantations, Miscellaneous, and in the general introduction explains
his mode of gathering the materials.

The glimpses of Highland life he gives in connection with his visits and
colloquies with the people are highly interesting.

“Whatever be the value of this work,” he says, “it is genuine folk-lore,
taken down from the lips of men and women, no part being copied from
books. It is the product of far-away thinking, come down on the long
stream of time. Who the thinkers and whence the stream, who can tell?
Some of the hymns may have been composed within the cloistered cells of
Deny and Iona, and some of the incantations among the cromlechs of
Stonehenge and the standing stones of Callarnis. These poems were
composed by the learned, but they have not come down through the
learned, but through the unlearned—not through the lettered few, but
through the unlettered many, through the crofters and cottars, the
herdsmen and shepherds of the Highlands and Islands.”

“The poems were generally intoned in a low, recitative manner, rising
and falling in slow modulated cadences, charming to hear but difficult
to follow. The music of the hymns had a distinct individuality, in some
respects resembling and in many respects differing from the old
Gregorian chants of the Church. I greatly regret that I was not able to
record this peculiar and beautiful music, probably the music of the old
Celtic Church.”

Following the advice and example of his acquaintance, J. F. Campbell of
Islay, whom he knew for a quarter of a century, Mr. Carmichael gives the
words and names of the reciters. But, unlike Campbell and Mackenzie and
Sinclair, he gives an English rendering of the original in every
instance. Thus, while to the vast majority of this nation _their_
felicitous poems are locked up in the Gaelic, _his_ are available to
all, in chaste and beautiful language, with charming letterpress,
embellished by old Celtic letters, artistically copied by his wife from
the ancient MSS. in Edinburgh and elsewhere.

Speaking of the original, he maintains that, although in decay, the
poems are in verse of a high order, with metre, rhythm, assonance,
alliteration, and every quality to please the ear and to instruct the
mind. Simple dignity, charming grace, passionate devotion, characterise
most of these pieces. Again and again he laid down his self-imposed
task, feeling unable to render the intense power and supreme beauty of
the original Gaelic into adequate English; but he persevered, thus
placing a stone as it were upon the cairn of those who composed and of
those who transmitted the work.

And now, a few characteristic specimens from the book may fitly close
this study. The first is an incantation beginning:—

                   The wicked who would do me harm,
                   May he take the (throat) disease
                   Globularly, spirally, circularly,
                   Fluxy, pellety, horny-grim, etc.

But scarcely any English can convey the vengeance of the vernacular.
Even the sounds are terrifying:—

                 Ulc a dhean mo lochd,
                 Gu’n gabh e’n galar gluc gloc,
                 Guirneanach, goirneanach, guairneach,
                 Gaornanach, garnanach, gruam.

Next, we quote two verses from “The Invocation of the Graces,”
interesting as containing beautiful names from the ancient sagas:—

                    A shade art thou in the heat,
                    A shelter art thou in the cold,
                    Eyes art thou to the blind,
                    A staff art thou to the pilgrim,
                    An island art thou at sea,
                    A fortress art thou on land,
                    A well art thou in the desert,
                    Health art thou to the ailing.

            Thine is the skill of the Fairy Woman,
            Thine is the virtue of Bride the calm,
            Thine is the faith of Mary the mild,
            Thine is the tact of the woman of Greece,
            Thine is the beauty of Eimer the lovely,
            Thine is the tenderness of Darthula delightful,
            Thine is the courage of Meve the strong,
                  Thine is the charm of Buine-bheul.

Now follows an example of a charm for sprain:—

                Christ went out
                In the morning early,
                He found the legs of the horses
                In fragments soft;
                He put marrow to marrow,
                He put pith to pith,
                He put bone to bone,
                He put membrane to membrane,
                He put tendon to tendon,
                He put blood to blood,
                He put tallow to tallow,
                He put flesh to flesh,
                He put fat to fat,
                He put skin to skin,
                He put hair to hair,
                He put warm to warm,
                He put cool to cool.
                As the King of power healed that
                It is in his nature to heal this,
                If it be in his own will to do it.
                  Through the bosom of the Being of life
                  And of the Three of the Trinity.

And, finally, we may take this as a good specimen of an invocation:—

              Bless, O Chief of generous Chiefs,
              Myself and everything anear me,
              Bless me in all my actions,
              Make Thou me safe for ever.
                  Make Thou me safe for ever.

              From every brownie and ban-shee,
              From every evil wish and sorrow,
              From every nymph and water-wraith,
              From every fairy mouse and grass-mouse,
                  From every fairy mouse and grass-mouse.

              From every troll among the hills,
              From every siren hard pressing me,
              From every ghoul within the glens,
              Oh! save me till the end of my day.
                  Oh! save me till the end of my day.

In recent years, Dr. George Henderson has done useful work in
transliterating several poems from the Fernaig MS., which, along with
many songs collected in the West Highlands, he has published in his
_Leabhar nan Gleann_. And to Henry Whyte and Malcolm Macfarlane the Gael
is indebted for an extensive gleaning in the field of vocal music. In
addition to numerous Gaelic melodies, they have rescued a variety of
excellent songs from impending oblivion and enhanced their value,
especially to those who are unacquainted with the original, by giving
literal renderings in English, which serve to exhibit their simple
beauty.

Nor have the three sister nationalities been behind in work of this
kind. The first important Irish gleaning has been Miss Brooke’s
_Reliques of Irish Poetry_, consisting of heroic poems, odes, elegies,
and songs, which she published in the original with English translations
and notes, Dublin, 1789. In more recent times we have the interesting
collections in English of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, Dr. Hyde, Dr.
Sigerson, Yeats, and others, besides the _Treasury of Irish Poetry_
lately edited by Stopford A. Brooke, and T. W. Rolleston. The latter
deals simply with the nineteenth century, but Dr. Sigerson’s _Bards of
the Gael and Gall_ is an Anthology of nearly a hundred and fifty poems
metrically translated, “covering the ground from the earliest unrhymed
chant ascribed to the first invading Milesian down to the peasant days
of the eighteenth century.”

Wales is well represented by the extensive Myvyrian Archaiology of Owen
Jones, 1801–1807, which capable Welshmen, such as Aneurin Owen, Thomas
Price, William Rees, John Jones and others, set themselves to finish;
while M. de la Villemarqué has done for Brittany, in his now famous
books, perhaps all the ancient gleaning it was possible to do at a
period so late as the middle of last century.




                              CHAPTER XIX
                THE MASTER SCHOLARS OF CELTIC LITERATURE

  The bards and seanachies—Six men of outstanding literary
      eminence—The earliest pioneer of the modern philological
      movement—Representatives of the older scholarship—Those
      of the new—The brilliant Zeuss—Foreign periodicals
      dealing with Celtic—Foremost scholars of the various
      nations—Italian—German—French—Danish—Scandinavian—American—British,
      including English, Irish, Welsh, Manx, and Scottish—Many literary
      problems solved—The promise of future harvests.


In the company of the scholars we still breathe the atmosphere of the
past. It is they who have resurrected the MSS. These monuments of
by-gone days are the quarries among which they work. As Burns “eyed with
joy the general mirth,” so do they scrutinise with eager glance the
much-prized vellum.

Only a scholar can know the pleasure it gives to hap upon a long-lost
relic of literature, to turn over its leaves, steeping the book in
water, if need be, to make its pages come asunder, and even using acid
to help the time-worn ancient one to deliver up its secret.

“Why bother with such defunct lore?” asks the man in the crowd, “the
past is over and gone. It is long since superseded.” Therein lies the
difference between him and the scholar. The scholar thinks it worth
while. Nay, he will sacrifice much—we shall repeatedly see—to search out
the contribution of the past, and determine its meaning. As Plato,
Aristotle, and the master-minds of ancient Greece wrote their books and
carried on their studies, knowing full well that these would be read and
assimilated by very few in their own day, there being no
printing-presses as now, and only a limited education; so many of the
Celtic scholars of our own time labour on in solitude, conscious also
that even with the printing-press the circle of their readers must be
small, yet knowing they are doing a work which in its own way is ever
widening the horizons of knowledge and enriching the common heritage of
mankind.

In the bards and seanachies, there have not been lacking from remote
times men who have interested themselves in the lore and learning of
their race; but we need to come down to more recent times to encounter
the class of writers we have specially in view in this study.

Happily, they are not confined to any one age or any one country. Yet
Ireland, as we might expect from its place in the Celtic group, figures
early and largely in the domain of Gaelic scholarship.

During the first half of the seventeenth century—to go no farther
back—it produced six men of outstanding literary eminence, who
represented a national scholarship in that country, the lustre of which
has never since been surpassed. These were Geoffrey Keating, Duald Mac
Firbis, and the Four Masters.

Keating, though born in Ireland, was of Norman extraction, and educated
abroad for the office of priest. On his return from Spain, a
full-fledged Doctor of Divinity, he was appointed to a church and
attracted great crowds as a preacher, till an incident, the most trivial
and fortuitous in its origin, drove him from the pulpit into literature.
The incident is worth recording as a determining factor in his
illustrious career. It seems that in his audience one day a young lady,
who was reputed to have questionable relations with a high dignitary of
the Province, happened to appear, curious, like all the rest, to hear
the great preacher. Keating, as fate would have it, was discoursing on
this occasion on a theme not likely to commend itself to the dissolute
girl; still less, since all eyes pointed the moral in her direction.

She had her revenge, for forthwith soldiers were dispatched by her
lordly patron to arrest the offending priest and make him prisoner. But
the latter hearing of this in time, made good his escape to the famous
glen of Aberlow, where he lived for years a hidden life. It was while
thus cashiered and ostracised that he conceived the idea of writing the
history of Ireland, from the earliest times to the Norman conquest,
afterwards travelling through the country in disguise, with Aberlow as
base, to consult the ancient MSS., which were then in the families of
the hereditary brehons and in the proximity of the old monasteries. Many
documents which existed in 1630, and which he perused, have since
disappeared. And his work is thus of great value, as he rewrote and
redacted their contents in his own words, like another Herodotus.

Duald Mac Firbis, his contemporary, was equally indefatigable in
ransacking the past for the benefit of the future. His _magnum opus_ is
_The Book of Genealogies_. O’Curry thinks it perhaps the greatest
national genealogical compilation in the world. In addition, he compiled
the _Chronicon Scotorum_, various glossaries, and, according to himself,
a dictionary of the Brehon laws.

Almost at the same time that Keating was writing his history in the
south of Ireland, the Four Masters were busy with theirs in the north.
Michael O’Clery, born at Donegal about 1580, was author of the Leabhar
Gabhala, or Book of Invasions, and other important works, but in
compiling the famous Annals, the greatest of all, he had the assistance
of other three eminent scholars, known as Farfasa O’Mulchonry, Peregrine
O’Clery, and Peregrine O’Duigenan. Hence the name “Four Masters,” given
by John Colgan of Louvain, himself worthy to rank after them as the
author of the _Trias Thaumaturga_, a book which owes its origin to the
vast collection of material amassed by Michael O’Clery throughout his
busy life. The latter work consists of two enormous Latin quartos, the
first containing the lives of Patrick, Brigit, and Columba; the second,
those of a number of other distinguished Irish saints.

From the middle of the seventeenth century we are carried forward to the
beginning of the eighteenth. And the next great name that illuminates
the pages of Celtic scholarship is that of a Welshman, Edward Lhuyd. A
peculiar interest and distinction attach to the work of this man,
inasmuch as he was the earliest pioneer of the modern philological
movement, and almost stumbled on the discoveries of Grimm and Rask,
which were only reached upwards of a century after his time.

An Oxford don, of Jesus College, he clearly saw the necessity of laying
a solid foundation for the scientific study of his own and kindred
languages, and, following up his ideal, he set about publishing
specimens of the literature and preparing vocabularies of the various
dialects. In pursuit of this laudable object he visited Ireland and
Scotland, and when his great work, the _Archæologica Britannica_, began
to appear about 1703, enthusiastic Celts from far and near sent him
congratulatory odes, some of which he afterwards printed. These poems
were either in Latin or in the mother tongue of their contributors.
Among the specimens sent from the Scottish Highlands, one, composed by
the Rev. John Maclean of Kilninian, Mull, has been justly described by
Professor Mackinnon as a “really admirable composition.”

           Great praise and thanks, O noble Lhuyd, be thine,
           True learned patriot of the Cambrian line!
           Thou hast awaked the Celtic from the tomb,
           That our past life her records might illume.
           Engraved in every heart in lettered gold
           Thy name remains; thy silent words unfold
           To future ages what our sires had seen,
           While others say, “A Gaelic race hath been.”

Such is one verse of the ode, as rendered in English by Dr. Nigel
Macneill.

Completed and printed at Oxford in 1707, the _Archæologica Britannica_
was, according to the title page, “delivered to the subscribers at 9s.
6d., being the remainder of their payment, and to others at 16s.”

As a scientific linguist, the reputation of its brilliant author was at
once established. His calibre may be inferred from the following
pregnant note, which he appended to an edition of Kirke’s Gaelic
Vocabulary in 1702. The note is in Latin to this effect:—

  Of these 360 Gaelic words, 160 agree, in sound and sense, with the
  British (Welsh) language. The letter _p_ in Welsh equates with the
  letter _c_ in Gaelic, _e.g._, pren, crann (tree); plant, clann; pen,
  ceann; pedwar, ceithir; pymp, cuig; pwy, cia; pasc, casg. _Gw_ of
  Welsh equates with Gaelic _f_, _e.g._, gwyn, fionn; gwin, fion; gwr,
  fear; gwair, feur; gwirion, firinneach. The Welsh _h_ corresponds with
  the Gaelic _s_, _e.g._, hen, sean; helig, seileach; heboc, seabhag;
  hil, siol; halen, salann; hyn, sin.

What was to prevent a man of such critical insight travelling towards
the interesting discovery of the position of the Celtic in the Aryan
group, or even the generalisation formulated in Grimm’s Law? Already he
was on the track, observing sound changes. He began with the Celtic
dialects, but had he lived, in all likelihood he would have carried his
equations to other languages of the Aryan group, and anticipated some at
least of the modern results. As it was, his early death occurred before
he had time to work out the idea on the wider platform; and the honour
of having laid a sure foundation for the new sciences of philology,
ethnology, and literary criticism passed a century and a half later to
the great German masters.

After Lhuyd’s time, unhappily in this country, his studies were not
followed up. On the contrary, the investigation of Celtic questions was
determined more by sentiment than by scholarship. Wrangling and
partisanship took the place of learning and scientific veracity. And so
far were the methods and results of later criticism from being
anticipated, that biassed men like Pinkerton and the Ossianic
controversialists had a loud voice in the land.

Gradually a better type of scholarship began to emerge both in Scotland
and Ireland. Not at first the representatives of the new order, but
representatives of the traditional seanachies, scholars of the long
past, who interested themselves afresh in the literature, history, and
antiquities of the race; and who began with unwearied zest to unearth
and bring to light the long lost and forgotten monuments of the past. Of
these, in Scotland, the brothers Donald and John Smith, Ewen Maclachlan,
Dr. Thomas Maclauchlan, and Dr. Archibald Clerk, were perhaps the most
prominent. As scholars they were rather uncritical, and do not rank in
the same category with the great names of later times; but they had
strong Gaelic sympathies and a large assortment of traditional
knowledge.

In Ireland, on the other hand, there were far more who occupied
themselves with the earlier periods. Of these it would be hard to rival
in patient, conscientious, and solid learning such men as O’Reilly,
Petrie, O’Donovan, O’Curry, Todd, Reeves, Hennessy, and Healy.

The first three were associated with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, and
in that sphere found excellent scope for their Celtic studies, in
connection with the place-names of the country.

John O’Donovan was born in 1809. His father, though a small farmer, had
been descended from the celebrated O’Donovans of County Cork, and when
he died in 1817 his son John, then eight years of age and one of a
family of nine, was sent to Dublin to be educated. From the age of
seventeen he began to devote himself systematically to Celtic study, and
three years later was brought under the notice of the Survey Commission
as a youth singularly well qualified to conduct the archæological
department of their enterprise. Accordingly he entered the service in
1829, and forthwith instituted a careful investigation of the printed
books, MSS., and inscriptions bearing on topography; in due course
contributing articles to the _Dublin Penny Journal_, and laying the
first instalment of his research before the British Association in 1835.
Subsequently, Petrie and he published the full report.

In 1836 he set about preparing an Analytical Catalogue of the Irish MSS.
in Trinity College, and from 1841 was editor of the works published by
the Irish Archæological Society. Ever since he undertook the work of the
Ordnance Survey, he had in view the idea of writing a _Grammar of the
Irish Language_, and after seventeen years’ study the book appeared in
1847, and was received with enthusiasm both at home and abroad. It is
characteristic of the way in which British scholarship followed in the
rear of that on the Continent, that so well informed and interested an
exponent as O’Donovan did not know when he published his valuable
Grammar that aspiration and ellipsis had been explained in Germany eight
years before then. Thus he arrived too early to benefit much by the
study of comparative philology, though deeply interested in the science.

His masterpiece is really the edition he issued of the _Annals of the
Four Masters_ (1848–51). Of this vast effort Dr. Hyde affirms that it is
the greatest that any modern Irish scholar ever accomplished. “So long
as Irish history exists, the _Annals of the Four Masters_ will be read
in O’Donovan’s translation.”

In 1847 he was called to the Bar, but sacrificed his prospects in that
line for his Celtic studies. Later, he received the degree of LL.D. from
Trinity College, Dublin, and a Government pension of £50 a year, and was
appointed Professor of the Irish Language in Queen’s College, Belfast.
But having a large family to support on a small income, he contemplated
emigrating to America or Australia, when in 1852, most opportunely, the
Government resolved to appoint a Royal Commission to publish the ancient
Laws and Institutions of Ireland, and he and O’Curry, the two greatest
savants on that subject, were chosen for the office. Eight years’ more
arduous work undermined his constitution, and he succumbed to an attack
of rheumatic fever about the middle of November 1861.

Eugene O’Curry did not long survive him. Neither of them lived to
complete the vast undertaking, though they both wrote and translated
volumes of text, which have since been published.

The immense labours and success of O’Curry in the difficult fields of
Gaelic research are even more astonishing than those of his coadjutor,
as he had never received an academical education, and was mainly
self-taught, and had to forge his way in new and unexplored directions.
In view of this his surprise was great when offered the Professorship in
the Catholic University of Ireland, and so diffident was he that it was
with difficulty he was persuaded to accept it. His catalogues, editions
of texts and translations, and, above all, his famous books, the
_Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History_ (Dublin,
1861), and _On the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish_ (London,
1873), have rendered him a kind of quarry for subsequent scholars,
British and Continental.

To Dr. Todd is mainly due the inception, in 1841, of the Irish
Archæological Society for publishing original documents. He figures also
as the first editor of the _Liber Hymnorum_, Dublin, 1855, and as the
biographer of St. Patrick, while Dr. Reeves has done masterly service as
editor and biographer of Adamnan.

Of the line of scholars we have just passed in review, William Maunsell
Hennessy is probably the last great representative. The better part of
forty years he spent in close familiarity with the great tomes in
Dublin, publishing, translating, and annotating, till the list of his
works have become too numerous to mention here. Among the chief of these
are his edition of the _Chronicon Scotorum_, in the Master of the Rolls’
Series, 1858; and his translation of the _Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick_, printed by Mary Frances Cusack, 1871, and by O’Leary, New
York, 1874.

“Hennessy,” says Standish O’Grady, “was born at Castle Gregory, some
twelve miles west of Tralee, and in early life visited the United
States. Upon his return to Ireland he became a journalist, and was
appointed to the Public Record Office, Dublin, in 1868. He enjoyed the
friendship of the Cavaliere Nigra, himself an accomplished Celticist,
and was his guest at the Italian Embassy in Paris. In 1885 he was
visited by a family bereavement, almost tragic in sadness, and this
again was before long followed by a second blow, the effect upon his
sensitive and affectionate nature being such that he never fairly
rallied, but died at the age of sixty.”

Having thus glanced briefly at the representatives of the older
scholarship and their work, we shall now have occasion to retrace our
steps to consider the representatives of the new critical and
philological movement. After Edward Lhuyd’s demise no further progress
seems to have been registered in the elucidation of Celtic philology
till the time of Franz Bopp. Even as late as the first quarter of the
nineteenth century, Gaelic was regarded by scholars as a peculiar
language, unconnected with the other European tongues. It is true that
Sir William Jones, from his study of Sanskrit, had thrown out the hint
as early as 1786, that Celtic was of the same original stock with the
other languages of Europe and South-Western Asia; but when Bopp first
published his _Comparative Grammar_ Celtic was omitted. It was Dr.
Pritchard, an English ethnologist, who, in 1832, really demonstrated on
the lines laid down by Grimm and Bopp, that the Celtic language is a
member of the Indo-European group.

His book, entitled _The Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations_, from this
time drew the attention of continental scholars to the excluded and
hitherto neglected language, with the result that three important works
soon after appeared, namely, first, one _On the Affinity of the Celtic
Languages with the Sanskrit_, by Adolph Pictet (Paris, 1837); second,
the _Die Celtischen Sprachen_, or _Celtic Philology_, by Bopp (Berlin,
1839); and the _Celtica_ of Dr. Diefenbach (Stuttgart, 1839–40).

By this time Bopp had studied the Celtic dialects, and published the
above work as a supplement to his great _Comparative Grammar of the
Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic, German, and Sclavonic
Languages_. Some features of Gaelic phonetics, such as initial
aspiration and ellipsis, taking the place of declension, seems hitherto
to have baffled scholars, but Bopp’s sagacity enabled him to perceive
that these are nothing else than the relics and results of the
after-action of the old case-endings, and that the rational explanation
is to be found in the final sound of the previous word, or, as we now
say, vocalic and nasal auslaut. This discovery has since been fully
confirmed by Zeuss, Ebel, and Windisch.

It was with the publication of the _Grammatica Celtica_, however, that
the great moment in the evolution of Celtic scholarship arrived. Its
gifted author, J. Caspard Zeuss, stands supreme as the real founder of
Celtic philology. He did for it what Grimm did for the Teutonic, and
Diez for the Romance. Since the appearance of his monumental work it has
been definitely settled that the Celtic languages are pure Indo-European
tongues, without any admixture of foreign elements, and thus that they
are members of the family in the same sense that Latin or Gothic is. In
addition, it has furnished the means of interpreting the most ancient
forms of the Gaelic language found in the very old MSS., which before
then had defied the efforts of translators.

Zeuss was born in Bavaria in July 1806, and after a brilliant school
career, he went to the University of Munich, as his friends intended
that he should be a clergyman. But the youth preferred linguistic
studies, for which it soon transpired that he had a unique genius; and,
college life over, he taught for seven years (from 1832–39) in the
Gymnasium of Munich. Meantime he pursued his own favourite science,
publishing in 1837 a work which is still authoritative. It dealt with
the German chiefly, but from the first his studies included the oriental
languages.

To settle in Berlin and support himself by teaching there had now become
the objective of his desire, as the Metropolis would furnish him with
exceptional opportunities, but being a Catholic, he found this
impossible. In 1839, however, he succeeded in getting a professorship in
the Lyceum in Spires, and went there from Munich. It was then he began
to study Celtic. How enormous the difficulties were for a man in his
position one can readily imagine, when it is remembered how widely
dispersed, unknown, and unintelligible the materials for the most part
were at that time. His income was small, but in order to economise his
resources, and have the wherewithal to pursue his researches, it is said
that he decided to remain a bachelor. It was his custom annually during
the vacation to visit the great libraries of London, Oxford, Würzburg,
St. Gall, and Milan for the perusal of the Gaelic documents. In the
preface to his great work, he even apologises for not having made full
use of the Milan glosses. This we know was not altogether his fault, for
he went twice there to study the MS. On the first occasion there
happened to be a convention of savants in the city, and the library was
closed, much to his disappointment. An epidemic of fever prevailed when
he returned the second time, and feeling certain sensations, he imagined
he had caught the infection, and left the place without accomplishing
the object of his visit. No doubt the overwrought student was nervous on
that occasion, and his fears may have got the better of him.

In 1847 he was appointed Professor of History in Munich. But his health
not being very robust, though he accepted the chair, he was obliged a
few months afterwards to resign. Fortunately, however, he received a
similar appointment in the Lyceum of Bamberg, which he was able to
maintain. This was his last. The _Grammatica Celtica_, which was to take
the learned world by surprise and revolutionise Celtic studies, appeared
in 1853, after thirteen years’ close and laborious work. It is written
in Latin, and is so profoundly erudite that it has the reputation, like
some other great German books, of being very difficult to grasp. The
numerous sources consulted in the production of this masterpiece of
scientific scholarship are all carefully given in the preface. Its
publication at once established his fame, but the work killed him. In
1855 he was compelled to resign his chair through broken health. That
same year Professor Siegfried of Dublin saw him, and afterward wrote the
following interesting impression which the appearance of the devoted
scholar made upon him. “I paid a visit,” he says, “to this remarkable
man in the vacation of 1855, when his health was fast sinking. He was a
tall, well-made, rather spare man, with black hair and moustache, giving
on the whole more the impression of a Sclavonian or a Greek than a
German.” He did not long survive his retirement, for in November 1856,
less than three years after the completion of his Grammar, this
illustrious linguist but modest and retiring man died in his native
village in Bavaria. To him, mindful of his outstanding influence, Dr
Whitley Stokes has not inaptly applied the Greek line—

            Ζεὺς ἀρχή, Ζεὺς μέσσα, Διὸς δ’ ἐκ πάντα τέτυκαι.

After the publication of the _Grammatica Celtica_, Celtic studies
received a mighty impetus and took great strides forward. Now that the
Celtic dialects were proved to be Aryan, their further study became a
necessity in connection with the comparative grammar of the whole
family. Already in Germany there was the well-known _Zeitschrift für
vergleichende Sprachkunde_ (Journal of Comparative Philology), a journal
specially devoted to the Germanic, Greek and Latin languages; but now in
1856, the _Beiträge zur vergleichenden Sprachforschung_ (Contribution to
Comparative Etymology) was started in Berlin to deal with the Aryan,
Celtic, and Sclavonic tongues, and giving particular attention to the
Celtic. The periodical went through eight volumes, one appearing in four
parts every two years; and when it came to an end the _Zeitschrift_,
edited by Dr. Kuhn, began to receive articles on Celtic subjects, and
continues to do so still.

Among the contributors to the _Beiträge_ Dr. Hermann Ebel was the most
notable. His Celtic studies in the journal were afterwards translated
and issued in book form by the late Professor Sullivan of Dublin (1863).
Of these the most important are _On Declension_, and _The Position of
the Celtic_. Ebel taught for thirteen years in Schniedmuhl, and when the
Chair of Comparative Philology, once occupied by Bopp, in Berlin, fell
vacant, he was appointed thereto, but he did not live long to fulfil its
duties, for he died in 1875, only two years later. He left, it is said,
in MS. a dictionary of Old Gaelic. His greatest Celtic work, however, is
the second edition of Zeuss’s Grammar published in 1871, which embodies
the results of Celtic scholarship down to that year.

In 1870 another important periodical, wholly devoted to Celtic studies,
began to be published in Paris, namely the _Revue Celtique_. It was the
appearance of this quarterly that ultimately led to the appointment of
D’Arbois de Jubainville as Commissioner to the British Isles, to report
on the Gaelic MSS. found there. This paper, which still flourishes, has
for over thirty years done good service in the interests of scholarship,
there being among its contributors such eminent writers as Ebel,
Windisch, Max Müller, Count Nigra, Pictet, Jubainville, Stokes, Rhys,
Macbain, and others.

Occasional articles continue to appear in several German papers, but it
may be of moment in passing to note that a few years ago a new
periodical, entitled _Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie_, was
floated, as well as an _Archiv für Celtische Lexicographie_, which shows
the interest that is still taken by the German philologists in this
department of study.

As the great succession of Celtic scholars after Zeuss and Ebel are more
or less contemporary, it will be most convenient to deal with them in
the order of nationality. Among foreigners of the first rank are two
Italians, Count Nigra and Ascoli of Milan. Nigra was for a time his
country’s ambassador in London and Paris. It will be remembered that
Hennessy, who enjoyed his friendship, was entertained by him at the
Italian Embassy in the latter city. His most important contribution,
founded on his own researches in Italy, is the _Reliquie Celtiche_,
published in that land in 1872. Ascoli did similar good work in
connection with the Gaelic glosses in the ancient MSS. of Milan and St.
Gall, supplementing the labours in that field of Zeuss, Ebel, and Nigra.

In Germany, on the other hand, there are four still actively engaged who
rank among the masters. First comes the brilliant Professor Windisch of
Leipzig. He is best known for his _Irische Texte_ (vol. i.), published
in Leipzig, 1880; and again a second series of the same, in
collaboration with Dr. Stokes, in 1884. It is a learned work with a
vocabulary arranged alphabetically, which goes most minutely into the
structure of the words. Such pieces as Cuchulinn’s Sickbed, the Vision
of Adamnan, the Tale of the Sons of Uisneach, Hymns from the _Liber
Hymnorum_, and Irish glosses from the MSS. in the monastery of St Paul
in Carinthia are among its varied contents. Windisch is Professor of
Sanskrit in Leipzig, and besides an Irish Grammar has published other
books bearing on Celtic philology. In some instances he has corrected
Zeuss, and in various directions developed and extended his principles.
At present he is engaged on a second edition of the above-mentioned
grammar, and on an elaborate edition with translation of the Táin Bó
Chuailgné.

Next to him comes Professor Zimmer, formerly of Greifswalde, now
Professor of Celtic in Berlin University. Two books stand to his credit
in 1881, _Irish Glosses_ and _Celtic Studies_. As a writer he expresses
fresh and interesting opinions on a great variety of subjects, such as
the pagan character of Irish literature, the ancient Celtic Church, the
“Táin Bó Chuailgné,” Old Middle Irish MSS., the Irish scholars upon the
Continent, Fiacc’s _Life of St. Patrick_, and the scansion of the
classical Irish metres.

Professor Thurneysen of Jena (now of Freiburg) distinguished himself by
preparing, along with B. Gütterbock, an elaborate index to the
_Grammatica Celtica_, which renders that work more complete and
accessible. It was published in 1881.

He, along with Dr. Christian Stern, Librarian of Berlin, complete the
quartette of famous German Celticists who have been for some time in the
field, though not the list of able scholars engaged in like studies in
that country. Other significant names are Drs. Holder, Finck, Zupitza,
Foy, and Sommer.

Nor has France in recent years been lacking in eminent men of similar
research. M. de la Borderie, Gaidos, De Jubainville, Lotti, Ernault,
Dottin, and Professor Loth of Rennes have all greatly advanced the
interests of Celtic philology and literature. Of these, D’Arbois de
Jubainville is perhaps the best known, on account of his literary
mission to the British Isles on behalf of the French Minister of Public
Instruction in 1881, and his subsequent catalogue of the MSS. As
Professor at the College of France and editor of the _Revue Celtique_,
he made numerous interesting contributions in journal and book form to
the modern literature of the subject, such as _Grammatical Studies on
the Celtic Languages_ and _Epopée Celtique en Irlande_.

Ernault occupied himself more with the Breton dialect and folk-lore,
Professor Loth with the Mabinogion and Welsh metrics.

Other Continental savants of great promise remain to be mentioned. They
belong to the northern nations, which have recently begun to develop a
lively enthusiasm for Celtic studies. Denmark is well to the front with
Professor Holger Pedersen, a pupil of Zimmer’s, and Dr. Sarauw of
Copenhagen, while Scandinavia is represented by Dr. Liden of Gothenburg.
Much is expected of these men on the lines on which scholarship now
travels. Hitherto America, so much engrossed with the problems of the
present, has been slow to enter upon a research which burrows so deeply
in the past, yet within the last few years two names have emerged which
are intimately associated with this subject, namely, those of the Rev.
Professor Henebry and Professor Robinson of Harvard. The one is
concerned with the translation of O’Donnell’s _Life of St. Columcille_,
the other with the collection of certain early Irish poems and sagas.

And now, returning to our own shores after contemplating the masters
abroad, it is pleasing to find so many who have distinguished themselves
in one way or another in this field. England, Ireland, Wales, the Isle
of Man, and Scotland have each furnished enthusiastic and capable men.

Foremost of these British scholars, and apparently now of all living
Celticists, stands Dr. Whitley Stokes. Next to Zeuss he has done more
than any other single man in this particular department of study and
research. His publications are a library in themselves, and deal with
Cornish, Breton, Old Welsh, as well as Irish and Gaelic. He has made
himself master of the field in a very thorough and scientific manner.
Perhaps his best known books are the _Irische Texte_, vol. i., 2nd
series, 1884; vol. ii., published at Leipzig, 1887; _The Tripartite Life
of St. Patrick_, 1887, and his _Goidelica_ (old and early-middle-Irish
glosses, prose and verse) which appeared twenty years before the others,
and reached a second edition in 1872. In it are given accurate
translations of the Gaelic prefaces and hymns of the _Liber
Hymnorum_—that ancient anthology which dates from the eleventh century.

Dr. Stokes, who is a son of Professor William Stokes, Dublin, studied
Irish with O’Donovan, and Sanskrit and Comparative Philology with
Professor Siegfried in Dublin. After a distinguished career in the
Indian Civil Service he retired and took up residence in London. It was
in Calcutta that the foundation of his great reputation as a Celtic
scholar was laid, and it was from that city that he first issued his
_Goidelica_. The preface is striking in its brevity and simplicity:—

  I have three objects in printing this book—one, to save the contents
  of my transcripts of the glosses at Turin, Milan, and Berne from the
  destruction which in this country anything solely entrusted to paper
  MSS. must sooner or later meet with; another, to give those excellent
  German philologists who, like Schleicher and Ebel, have expressed a
  desire for trustworthy copies of Old Irish compositions, material on
  which they may look with confidence; and, thirdly, to lay the first
  stone of the cairn which I hope to raise to the memory of my beloved
  friend and teacher, Siegfried.

The cairn has since been raised, and it is indeed a notable one. Besides
his books, contributions from Dr. Stokes may be found in Continental
journals, such as the _Beiträge zur vergleichenden Sprachforschung_ of
Berlin, and the _Revue Celtique_ of Paris. He is still busy in his
island home at Cowes, editing and translating texts, of which the
_Annals of Tighernach_, the _Amra Choluimcille_, _Agallamh na
Seanorach_, and the _Bruiden Da Derga_ have lately been published.

Other great names in this country are those of Professor Rhys of Oxford,
a Welshman; Professor Atkinson of Dublin, a Yorkshireman; Dr. Kuno Meyer
of Liverpool, a German; Dr. Strachan of Manchester, Professor of Greek
and Comparative Philology, a native of Keith, Banffshire; Dr. Douglas
Hyde, whose interesting book on the _Literary History of Ireland_ has
just recently appeared; Dr. Norman Moore, the poetical Dr. Sigerson, and
the Professors Gwynne, father and son. Of these Principal Rhys has
hitherto perhaps been the most prolific in dealing with the early
history and problems of Celtic Britain, while the others have interested
themselves more in the language and literature.

There are two other outstanding names very familiar to the student of
Celtic, the erudite Standish Hayes O’Grady, author of _Silva Gadelica_,
and friend of Windisch for many years, and Mr. Alfred Nutt, an authority
on folk-lore and literary antiquities. Besides Rhys, Wales has produced
such indefatigable workers as Gwenogfryn Evans and Canon Silvan Evans,
the veteran of Welsh philology; Professors Morris Jones and Lewis Jones,
of Bangor; the late Charles Ashton; Professor Anwyl of Aberystwyth, and
Mr. Brynmor Jones; while the Isle of Man has Mr. A. W. Moore and Mr.
Kermode.

In Scotland during the middle of last century Dr. Skene did much to
revive interest in the history and monuments of the past, by collecting
MS. materials, editing the _Four Ancient Books of Wales_, and publishing
his own voluminous _Celtic Scotland_.

The first scholar north of the Tweed to assimilate the results of
Zeuss’s labours and follow his lead was the late Dr. Cameron of Brodick;
very industrious, as may be seen from his contributions to the
magazines, and his posthumous work, the _Reliquiæ Celticæ_, but sadly
lacking in system and method. After him come Dr. Macbain of Inverness, a
distinguished philologist, whose Gaelic Dictionary is a valuable
contribution to Celtic etymology, and the Rev. John Kennedy; the late
Sheriff Nicholson; Professor Mackinnon, occupant of the Edinburgh Chair
of Celtic Literature, and Dr. Henderson, a former student of his, who
has since studied abroad and written various papers and books, and
edited poems or tales collected in the Highlands.

These all represent the forces of scholarship in the highways and
by-ways of Celtic literature. They are not all masters, in the technical
sense of the word; not a few of them are, as we have already seen, and
the marvel is, looking back for fifty years, the number of men of the
first rank who have appeared, in great part on the Continent but also in
our own land. It is truly a recrudescence or re-arising of the Celt.
Spent forces seem suddenly to have re-emerged and overflowed the
foremost files of time, taking science captive and using it as their
instrument. And yet people wonder and inquire and continue to ask for
evidence of a Celtic renaissance.

Many literary problems have within the last half-century been solved,
but many more remain to be unravelled—questions too, of history,
ethnology, and sociology. But so much has already been done—so much that
a century ago seemed visionary and impossible, and had not even appeared
on the horizon of dreamers, that there is the promise of future
harvests, and still unlimited scope for the masters.

Thus the progress. First the available materials had to be ascertained,
catalogued, sifted, and examined in every land. Then followed the work
of publishing and interpreting the texts which have already yielded such
interesting philological and ethnical results, and now we look for a
further synthesis in other directions from the hints and suggestions
scattered all over these published records, which will throw light on
the fascinating problems which confront the students of history,
ethnology, archæology, and of the beliefs and customs of the race in its
earlier stages—a study in keeping with the human experience, that to go
on we must often go back.

be renamed.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
