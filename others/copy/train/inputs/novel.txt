The world had been green, alive, moments ago. Sun-dappled leaves, the scent of warm earth – an idyllic canvas. Then, she had arrived. And summer had died.

A predatory frost uncoiled from her, a tangible wave of frigid despair. It spread with horrifying speed, killing vibrant hues, replacing them with stark monochrome. The air, once a caress, now bit with a blizzard’s teeth. Snow, thick as a funeral shroud, fell with furious intensity, a white, suffocating rage.

The youth on the ground felt the change deep within his bones, a creeping cold mirroring the numbness from his grievous wounds. His blood, crimson seconds before, was crystallizing into grotesque, ruby-like shards. It crunched faintly when he tried to shift, the effort sending searing, then numbing, pain through him. Pain itself was fading, replaced by the insidious cold stealing sensation, turning his limbs to stone.

He blinked slowly, snowflakes catching on his lashes, refreezing into sharp needles. His gaze drifted to the sky – no longer azure, but a churning maelstrom of bruised purple and angry grey, the source of the unnatural snow. It seemed the heavens grieved, or raged.

Then, through the swirling white, she came into view, a figure of impossible, heart-stopping beauty, stark against the dying world she’d created. Her raven hair, darker than midnight, billowed around her like a storm cloud, untouched by the snow. Her eyes, wide and luminous, were polished obsidian, reflecting the icy desolation yet burning with an internal fire – a volatile, tormented incandescence. They were windows to a soul consumed by a blizzard of conflicting emotions.

She moved with lethal grace, leaving no footprints, a phantom of winter’s bleakest dream. Tears streamed down her flawless cheeks. Not warm tears, but ones that transformed instantly in the biting air, crystallizing into glittering, razor-sharp icicles clinging to her skin like macabre jewels, or shattering on the frozen ground with the sound of tiny, breaking bells – a delicate, chilling music for this private apocalypse. The cold emanating from her was a soul-deep chill, a winter of the heart made manifest.

She reached him, a dark angel, and knelt. The hem of her dark gown, embroidered with silver threads like trapped starlight, pooled around her. The snow seemed to part for her, reluctant to mar her terrible beauty. Her obsidian eyes fixed on his, drinking in his stillness, his pallor, the frozen testament of his blood.

His own gaze, the color of a stormy sea on the cusp of freezing, met hers. Empty. Devoid of fear, hatred, or any plea. A calm, desolate expanse.

"My love," she whispered, her voice a silken caress edged with breaking ice. The words were a grotesque parody of tenderness. Snowflakes settled in her raven hair, melting against the unnatural cold radiating from her skin.

"Do you feel it?" she murmured, one slender, gloveless hand, pale as winter moonlight, hovering just above his paling cheek, her fingertips radiating a cold that was almost a burn. "The world… it weeps with me. It freezes for our final embrace."

He said nothing. His storm-grey eyes remained fixed on hers, a flat, unreadable expanse. No flicker of their shared past, no defiance, no hint of the passionate fire that had once burned between them. Only a vast, weary emptiness. An emptiness that clawed at her, a silent rebuke more piercing than any scream.

A single ice-tear detached from her cheek, landing on the frozen blood crusting his tunic with a tiny, almost inaudible click.

"I love you," she stated, the words a raw, broken sound, like a wounded bird’s cry. "So much. More than life. More than my sanity. More than the sun." Her obsidian eyes, for a fleeting moment, filled with an agonizing tenderness, a glimpse of the love now fueling this destructive act. He has to see it, to feel it, even now, she pleaded internally. This isn't cruelty; it's… preservation.

"And because I love you so profoundly," she continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, a lover sharing a terrible, intimate secret, "because this love is a fire that consumes me, a madness that will not let me rest… I must do this. I must claim you. Entirely."

His expression did not change. No shock. No fear. Not even surprise. As if she’d merely commented on the weather.

This… this infuriating, soul-crushing emptiness in his gaze… it was worse than any hatred. It was a negation. A void where her passion, her pain, her very existence, found no purchase. Look at me! her soul screamed. Feel something! Hate me! Anything but this… this nothing! It was an insult to the inferno raging within her.

"Don't you understand?" she pleaded, her voice cracking, the ice-tears falling faster, a glittering cascade. "This is the only way. To keep you. To preserve this moment, this terrible, perfect intensity. Before you change further. Before you… forget." Her gaze hardened again, a flicker of dark, fierce possessiveness. The brief vulnerability vanished, replaced by a chilling, almost ecstatic resolve. If he offered nothing, she would carve her meaning onto his stillness.

"After your beautiful, stubborn heart has stilled," she promised, her voice a chilling vow against the wind’s howl, "I will follow. I will join you in the endless, frozen dark. I will hold you, my love, for all eternity. Our final, perfect, unbreakable embrace. Together. Always."

He blinked slowly, a languid, almost dismissive movement, the only sign he still perceived her terrible, beautiful, insane intent.

The silence stretched, broken only by the whispering snow and her ragged breathing, each exhalation a white plume. With a sigh carrying the weight of a dying world, she moved. Her slender form settled onto his chest, the pressure increasing, a deliberate, ritualistic claiming. Her raven hair fell around them, a silken curtain, creating a private, claustrophobic world of shadow and chilling intimacy.

Her hands, pale and cold as marble, rose, hovered above his throat, fingers trembling almost imperceptibly – the only betrayal of the maelstrom within. Then, they descended. Long, strong fingers wrapped around his neck, the touch firm, possessive, inescapable.

She could feel the faint tremor in her grip. This is love, she told herself, a desperate affirmation. This is the ultimate act of devotion.

"This… this coldness in your eyes, my love," she whispered, her face inches from his, obsidian gaze boring into his, searching, desperate, for something no longer there. "This terrible, empty glare… it is the same glare I once turned upon you, is it not?" A flicker of painful memory crossed her eyes – a time when their roles were reversed.

"When I was the ice, and you were the fire," she murmured, her voice thick with a sorrow transcending grief. "When my heart was a frozen fortress, and your desperate, foolish passion beat against its walls, seeking an entry I so cruelly, so proudly, denied."

Her grip tightened, stealing his shallow breath, making dying lights dance before his fading eyes. The cold from her fingers seeped into his skin, a prelude to the eternal winter she promised.

"You hated me then, didn't you?" she accused, her voice low, broken, thick with tears freezing directly onto his chilling skin. "You despised my coldness, my refusal to yield to your… relentless, consuming affection. You looked at me with that same burning emptiness then, your unrequited love turning to ash." Or did you? Was it hate, or was it this… this same awful indifference? The unwelcome thought pricked at her.

His gaze remained unchanged. Detached. Empty. A mirror reflecting only the cold desolation she’d created. No hatred. No anger. No love. Only profound, transcendent weariness.

No! Her mind recoiled. It must be hatred! He must feel something as strong as what I feel! "This hatred you feel for me now," she declared, voice rising with manic triumph, fingers digging deeper, cutting off his air, a desperate attempt to impose her narrative onto his dying gaze. "This beautiful, burning hatred… I will not let it fade! I will freeze it, here, now, for all eternity! By ending you! By preserving this moment where your soul finally mirrors the ice I once offered! We will be one, finally, in this frozen tableau of passion and pain!"

Her words were a torrent, a desperate attempt to find meaning, passion, even a twisted reflection of her love, in the void she met. To believe his state was a mirror of her past, a shared intensity, rather than a complete negation of everything she felt.

But there was nothing. Only the tightening grip, the fading light, the encroaching cold. He didn't struggle, beyond involuntary, weakening spasms. He didn't plead. He didn't even blink.

His eyes, the color of a winter sea just before it freezes solid, remained fixed on hers, a silent, damning testament to her failure. Her passionate, destructive love, her desperate need for a shared, eternal torment, found no purchase, no echo, in the vast, cold emptiness of his final moments. He was already drifting, leaving only the shell.

Suddenly, a tremor ran through her. Not of cold, but of something else. A stark, horrifying realization pierced the fog of her madness. His lack of struggle wasn't acceptance; it was… indifference. A profound, soul-deep indifference her fire could not touch, her ice could not truly claim.

Her grip, absolute moments before, faltered. Just a fraction. The manic light in her eyes flickered, shifting from crazed certainty to a dawning, terrifying confusion. This wasn't right. He was supposed to fight, to glare, to show something she could capture, freeze, possess.

"No..." she breathed, the word a wisp of vapor, laced with a new, sharper pain. "Not... silent. Not empty." Her fingers loosened almost imperceptibly. Air, sharp and frigid, scraped into his starving lungs. He coughed, a weak, rattling sound, frozen blood cracking on his tunic.

Her obsidian eyes, wide and now laced with a dawning horror that superseded her earlier resolve, stared at him. He was still alive, barely. The "perfect moment" she had sought to create had been flawed, wrong. His emptiness was not her past coldness reflected; it was something else, something she couldn't fathom, couldn't control.

"You… you won't even give me your hatred?" she whispered, the accusation raw, wounded, lost. The grand, tragic opera she had envisioned was falling apart, replaced by a silent, bleak tableau of misunderstanding.

The raven-haired beauty knelt above him, her ice-tears continuing their silent descent, mingling with the frost on his skin. The world she had crafted for their eternal, passionate end now felt… hollow. He was alive, but the connection she sought to forge through death had eluded her. His silence was a louder scream than any curse.

The snow fell harder, a final curtain on their tragic, frozen stage. But he was still breathing, a faint mist against the icy air, and she… she was left with the terrifying, unexpected burden of his life, and the ruins of her mad, loving plan. The abyss of her love had sought an echo and found only the chilling whisper of his fading pulse. What now? What did eternity look like when its foundation had just crumbled to ice dust?
Lloyd Ferrum, Arch Duke's heir, let out a sigh. Not just any sigh, mind you. This was a sigh that carried the weight of roughly 105 years of existence crammed rather uncomfortably into the body of a 19-year-old. It was his tenth such sigh since waking up on this ridiculously plush, yet undeniably not-a-bed, sofa.

Okay, Lloyd, deep breaths, he thought, mimicking the calming techniques he’d learned during a brief, regrettable yoga phase in his eighties on Earth. In... and out. Just like Mrs. Henderson taught before she tried to sell me that ‘miracle’ kale powder.

He pushed himself up slightly, the unfamiliar (yet horribly familiar) tautness of youthful muscles protesting mildly. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows of the bedroom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, indifferent fairies. This was his room. His room in the Ferrum Estate, in the capital city of the Arch Duchy, on the planet Riverio.

A planet he had died on at the tender age of twenty-five.

Right, his internal monologue continued, picking up speed like a runaway minecart. So, recap: Born Lloyd Ferrum. Lived 25 years. Died. Cause? Still fuzzy, probably something embarrassing or pointlessly heroic. Reborn on Earth. Lived a full, technologically advanced, magically devoid 80 years. Had coffee, discovered sarcasm, learned about taxes, even had grandkids who thought I was ancient history. Died peacefully in my sleep, surrounded by… well, mostly medical equipment, but the sentiment was there.

He paused his mental rambling. And now…

He glanced around the opulent room again. The heavy velvet curtains, the polished dark wood furniture, the faint scent of expensive potpourri.

…Now I’m back. Nineteen years old. On the sofa.

He risked a peek over the armrest. There, cocooned in a mountain of silken sheets and blankets on the enormous four-poster bed, was the reason for his current seating arrangement. Rosa Siddik. His wife.

Newlywed wife, he corrected himself mentally with another, slightly more pained sigh. Married for precisely one week.

One week. And seven nights spent contemplating the intricate patterns on the ceiling from this very sofa.

The memory of their wedding night resurfaced, unbidden and unwelcome, like a tax audit. He’d been nervous, sure. It was an arranged marriage, a political joining of the powerful Ferrum family and the respectable, if less influential, Viscount Siddik's family. He hadn't expected storybook romance, but maybe… politeness? A shared awkward giggle?

Instead, he’d entered the room, heart thumping a nervous rhythm against his ribs, probably looking like a startled goose.

(Flashback - Wedding Night)

"Rosa…?" he'd ventured, his voice cracking slightly. Nineteen-year-old Lloyd had not been the suave operator his eighty-year-old Earth self occasionally imagined he was.

She was already in bed, sitting bolt upright, clutching the covers like a shield. Her eyes, wide and surprisingly fierce for a seventeen-year-old girl who looked like she might break if the wind blew too hard, fixed on him.

"Don't!" The word was sharp, cutting through the heavy silence of the room. Her voice trembled, but not, he suspected, entirely from fear. There was anger there too. "Don't come near me."

Lloyd froze, halfway between the door and the bed. "But… it's… you know." He gestured vaguely, feeling heat creep up his neck. "Our wedding night." Smooth. Real smooth.

"I know perfectly well what night it is!" she snapped, pulling the covers higher. "Just… stay over there. Please." The 'please' sounded forced, like a last-minute addition taught by a protocol tutor. "The bed is mine."

He blinked. "Mine? But it's… our bed?"

"It's my side," she clarified, gesturing emphatically to the entire mattress. "You… find somewhere else." Her gaze flickered towards the sofa against the far wall. "There."

Nineteen-year-old Lloyd, bless his cotton socks, had been completely flummoxed. Faced with a determined, if slightly teary-eyed, teenage bride barricaded in bed, his repertoire of responses had apparently been limited to stunned silence and retreat.

"Oh," he'd managed. "Right. The sofa. Good idea. Very… spacious." He’d backed away slowly, feeling utterly ridiculous.

(End Flashback)

Spacious, current Lloyd scoffed internally, rubbing a crick in his neck. And lumpy.

He remembered his past self’s rationale: ‘She’s young, probably scared. Give her space. Be a gentleman.’ He snorted softly. Right. A gentleman. Or maybe just a coward who didn’t know what else to do. For three long years in that first timeline, until his untimely demise, the sofa had remained his primary domain within this room. The last three years of his life, however, were spent on the battlefield. He’d never pushed, never demanded. He’d just… coexisted awkwardly with the girl who shared his name but not his bed.

And look where that got me, he thought grimly. Dead at twenty-five. He didn't know the exact cause, the memories around his death were hazy, like a poorly tuned television screen. But he knew it hadn't been from old age or a peaceful surrender. It had been sudden, violent, and likely connected to the turbulent politics and power struggles inherent in this world. Struggles his timidity had left him woefully unprepared for.

He sighed again. That made eleven. A new record.

Chapter : 2

Wait a minute, a different thought sparked, pushing aside the marital woes and existential dread for a moment. If I’m back… does that mean…?

He closed his eyes, concentrating. In his first life here, the System had been gibberish – screens full of an alien language (English, as he later learned on Earth) that meant nothing to his Riveriyan-speaking self. On Earth, he’d finally understood it, tinkering with it idly, like a strange mobile game he couldn't quite uninstall. But Earth had no Void Power, no Spirits. The System had been a curiosity, nothing more.

Come on, you overgrown plant-themed shopping list… show yourself.

He focused, picturing the interface he remembered from Earth.

Flicker.

A translucent screen shimmered into existence in his vision, unseen by the outside world.

[Welcome Back, User Lloyd Ferrum!]

[System: The Shopping Tree - Fully Operational]

[Current System Coins: 0]

[Shop Access Cost: 10 System Coins]

Hah! A genuine grin, the first since waking up, touched Lloyd's lips. It worked. It was here. And thanks to eighty years spent learning English on Earth, he could actually read it this time.

"Zero coins," he muttered under his breath, the grin fading slightly. "Stingy as ever, I see." He remembered the grind on Earth – trying to figure out what counted as a 'task'. Apparently, 'successfully adulting' didn't offer many coin rewards.

But here? In Riverio? This changed everything.

This world ran on Spirit Power and Void Power. Inherited abilities, summoned spirits, complex power rankings from F to SSS and beyond. His family, the Ferrums, were an Arch Duke household – powerful, influential, but always teetering on the edge of political machinations. His father, Roy Ferrum, was strong. His mother, Milody Austin, equally so. Even his younger sister, Jothi, showed promise.

And him? Lloyd Ferrum, the first time around? He'd been… average. Pathetically average for an Arch Duke's heir. One Spirit Core, yes, but mediocre compatibility. A decent enough inherited Void Power from his father, but nothing spectacular. He hadn't even reached the Ascension stage with his Spirit before his death. And that spirit was a dog who could not even use magic.

But now…

He looked at the flickering System interface again. Buy Spirits. Customize abilities. Buy Void Powers. Rank them up.

This wasn't just a second chance at life. This was a chance to potentially rewrite his entire destiny. To not die face-down in some ditch at twenty-five. To maybe, just maybe, figure out what the hell was actually going on.

And perhaps, eventually, graduate from the sofa.

First things first. He needed System Coins. Ten just to open the shop. How did he get them again? Tasks. Missions. Trading valuables.

He eyed the opulent room. There had to be something he could trade. A loose gem? A decorative silver button? He mentally scanned his own meager possessions from back then. Probably nothing worth 10 System Coins.

Okay, tasks it is. What counted as a task? Getting off the sofa without waking the sleeping dragoness in the bed? Seemed like a high-difficulty mission right now.

He carefully, slowly, swung his legs off the sofa, his movements measured and silent, honed by decades of practice (both the original sofa years and the Earth years of trying not to wake up his wife when getting up for a midnight snack). His feet touched the plush carpet.

So far, so good.

He stood up, stretching cautiously. His back popped. Definitely nineteen.

He needed information. What exactly was the date? How long after the wedding was it really? Had anything significant happened in the week since the wedding that his past self had blithely ignored?

He glanced back at the bed. Rosa hadn't stirred. Her breathing was deep and even. For a moment, seeing her like this, unguarded, young, he felt a pang of something other than awkwardness. She was trapped in this political marriage just as much as he was. Maybe even more so. In his first life, he’d never really tried to understand her side of things.

Another thing to potentially change, he mused. But that was a problem for later. Much later. After coffee. And preferably, after acquiring god-like powers via a cosmic shopping catalogue.

Right now? Operation: Escape the Bedroom and Find Coins was a go. He tiptoed towards the door, his bare feet sinking into the expensive rug. Each step felt like navigating a minefield.

He reached the door, his hand hovering over the ornate brass handle.

Just gotta... turn it... slowly...

The click of the latch sounded like a gunshot in the quiet room. He froze, glancing back at the bed.

Rosa shifted, murmuring something in her sleep, then settled again.

Lloyd let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He slipped out of the room, closing the door with painstaking care behind him. Freedom. And the faint, lingering scent of expensive potpourri.

Now, for the real challenge: navigating the Ferrum Estate as a 19-year-old nobody with the memories of an 80-year-old Earthling and a desperate need for magical game currency.

This, he thought, a strange mix of dread and exhilaration bubbling within him, is going to be interesting.
Lloyd Ferrum, temporarily displaced soul and current occupant of a body that felt suspiciously like it still owed library fines from its previous run, ambled through the grand, sunlit corridors of the Ferrum Estate. He sighed. Again. He was pretty sure his sigh-count was approaching double digits before breakfast, which had to be some kind of record, even for someone juggling memories from two separate lifetimes.

At least I can walk without my knees sounding like bubble wrap, he conceded internally, flexing his fingers. Being nineteen again had its perks. No mysterious aches that appeared after sleeping funny, no need for reading glasses perched precariously on his nose, no existential dread triggered by daytime television commercials selling walk-in bathtubs. Just the regular, run-of-the-mill existential dread of waking up six years in the past in a world with magic, political marriages, and a distinct lack of decent pizza delivery.

He passed another ancestral portrait. This one featured a grim-faced Ferrum ancestor with an improbably large moustache and armor that looked as if it weighed more than Lloyd currently did. The painted eyes seemed to follow him, silently judging his posture or perhaps his choice of sleepwear (which, thankfully, he'd swapped for presentable day clothes before venturing out).

Alright, Great-Uncle Theron the Belligerent, Lloyd thought, giving the portrait a mock salute. Don't worry, I'll try not to pawn the family silver. Unless the System gives me a really good exchange rate.

The thought of the System, his 'Shopping Tree', brought a flicker of excitement that quickly warred with the sheer weirdness of it all. A cosmic shop interface only he could see, offering superpowers in exchange for... well, he wasn't sure yet. Tasks? Shiny rocks? Fulfilling his father's expectations? The possibilities were disturbingly vague.

He reached the imposing double doors of the main family dining room. Carved with intricate scenes of heroic Ferrums doing heroic things (mostly involving pointy objects and mythical beasts), they felt heavier than they looked. He pushed them open.

Sunlight streamed through arched windows, illuminating a scene of quiet domesticity – albeit a very wealthy, aristocratic version of it. The long mahogany table, polished to a mirror shine, could comfortably seat thirty, but currently hosted only two.

At the far end, his father, Arch Duke Roy Ferrum, sat ramrod straight, engrossed in a stack of official-looking documents bound in leather. His dark hair showed no hint of grey (unlike the distinguished silver Lloyd remembered him having later in the first timeline), and his jaw was set in a permanently determined line. He radiated 'Do Not Disturb Unless the Castle is Actively on Fire' energy.

Across from him, nursing a delicate porcelain cup, was his mother, Milody Austin. Duchess Ferrum. She was the picture of refined grace, her silver-blonde hair swept up elegantly, her morning gown immaculate. She looked serene, but Lloyd knew from past experience that her calm exterior hid a will as strong as her husband's, just wielded with more subtlety and significantly less yelling.

"Lloyd, dear," Milody's voice was calm, carrying easily across the vast space. She offered him a small, practiced smile as he entered. "You decided to join the living. Come, sit. Cook made those honey-glazed sausages you profess to enjoy."

Profess to enjoy? Lloyd mentally raised an eyebrow. Okay, maybe nineteen-year-old me was a bit dramatic about sausages. "Morning, Mother. Father," he said, sliding into his customary seat – strategically placed far enough from his father to avoid accidental document-spillage, but close enough to reach the salt.

A servant materialized silently, placing a steaming plate before him. Eggs, fluffy and yellow. Sausages, glistening under their glaze. Thick slices of warm bread, accompanied by butter sculpted into the shape of a Ferrum family crest – a roaring lion that looked vaguely constipated. Aristocracy, Lloyd thought, it's all about the details.

He picked up his fork, the familiar weight grounding him slightly. Food. Glorious, non-rehydrated food. He took a bite of sausage. Sweet, savory, definitely better than the protein bars he practically lived on during crunch time back on Earth.

The peaceful chewing lasted approximately fifteen seconds.

"Your business tutelage," Roy Ferrum stated, the words dropping into the quiet room like stones. He still hadn’t looked up from his papers. His focus remained absolute, multitasking disapproval and ducal duties with practiced ease. "Report."

Lloyd froze mid-chew, the delicious sausage suddenly feeling like sawdust in his mouth. Aaaand here we go. Business studies. The consolation prize for the genetically underwhelming heir. In his first life, he’d resented it, slacked off, scraped by with mediocre grades, much to his father’s barely concealed disappointment.

"Progress?" Roy prompted, his pen scratching across a document. The sound grated on Lloyd's nerves.

Right. Business. What did nineteen-year-old him even know? Supply curves? Profit margins? How to look busy while secretly reading forbidden novels under the desk? His Earth life knowledge, however, was a different story. Decades spent navigating corporate structures, understanding market fluctuations (even if they were for things like holographic projectors and self-lacing shoes, not enchanted textiles and griffin eggs), and dealing with personalities far more challenging than a stuffy Riverian economics tutor.

Chapter : 4

Wait, who was the tutor again? Lloyd searched his hazy nineteen-year-old memories. Professor Abernathy? Grumbles? Something vaguely Dickensian. He decided to invent.

"It's proceeding adequately, Father," Lloyd began, choosing his words carefully. He swallowed the sausage lump. "Professor Quentin Grumbaldi seems pleased with my grasp of foundational principles." Yeah, Grumbaldi. Sounds legit.

He decided to embellish, drawing on faint recollections of Earth-based economics lectures he’d occasionally absorbed via osmosis while working on physics problems. "We were just reviewing trade tariffs and commodity valuation concerning the southern provinces. Grumbaldi noted my…" he paused, searching for a suitably impressive but vague term, "...innovative perspective on cross-border arbitrage." Nailed it. Probably.

Roy’s pen stopped scratching. He finally looked up, his dark eyes fixing on Lloyd with unnerving intensity. It wasn't disbelief, exactly, but sharp assessment. Like a hawk spotting a slightly unusual rabbit.

"Grumbaldi?" Roy frowned slightly. "Wasn't your tutor Master Elmsworth?"

Blast. Lloyd scrambled internally. Abort! Abort the Grumbaldi Gambit! "Ah, yes, Master Elmsworth, of course," he corrected smoothly, hoping the slight flush rising on his neck wasn't too obvious. "My apologies, Father. Thinking of... a character in a book. Elmsworth. He seems… satisfied." Satisfied that I show up, mostly.

Roy's gaze lingered for a moment longer before he returned to his papers, apparently accepting the flimsy excuse. Or perhaps just filing it away for later interrogation. "Satisfied is insufficient, Lloyd," he stated, his tone flat. "Adequate is unacceptable."

He tapped the document in front of him with a decisive finger. "These numbers," he said, his voice resonating with authority, "represent the lifeblood of thousands. Our shipping concerns in the Azure Strait. The timber resources from the Whisperwood. The mining concessions near Dragon's Tooth Peak."

He looked up again, his expression stern. "Generations of Ferrums bled to secure these holdings. Through strength of arms, through shrewd alliances, through unwavering will. That legacy is maintained not just by warriors, but by astute minds capable of managing and expanding our interests."

"This family demands excellence," Roy continued, his voice lowering slightly but losing none of its intensity. "Whether it's commanding troops on a battlefield, negotiating treaties in the Royal Court, or balancing ledgers in a counting house. A Ferrum does not merely participate. A Ferrum excels."

The implication hung heavy in the air. Excel in something, Lloyd, because you clearly aren't excelling in the traditional Ferrum way.

Lloyd felt a familiar prickle of resentment, the ghost of his nineteen-year-old self chafing under the weight of expectation. But the eighty-year-old within him, the one who had been a science student, an engineer, and an army officer on Earth, saw it differently now. He saw the immense pressure on Roy Ferrum, the Arch Duke holding together vast territories, navigating treacherous political currents, and worrying about an heir who, by all conventional measures, was… lacking.

He remembered brief, awkward moments from before. His father trying to teach him the basic sword stances, his own clumsy fumbling, yet the flicker of something – not quite pride, maybe hope? – in Roy’s eyes when Lloyd accidentally managed a parry that wasn't immediately suicidal. He remembered the endless stream of tutors, the expensive equipment, the subtle inquiries about his progress, all delivered with the same gruff formality.

It wasn’t disdain, Lloyd realized with sudden clarity. It was fear. Fear for Lloyd's future in a world that preyed on the weak. Fear for the legacy he was supposed to carry. The business studies weren't a punishment; they were a lifeline, thrown by a man who didn't know how else to protect his strangely un-Ferrum-like son. The stern lectures weren't about disappointment in Lloyd's lack of Void Power; they were about instilling some kind of strength, any kind, that might help him survive.

The revelation settled over him, replacing the old resentment with a strange mix of empathy and determination.

"I understand, Father," Lloyd said, his voice steady and clear. He met his father's gaze directly, holding it. "You demand results. I will provide them. In my studies, and in managing any responsibilities you see fit to give me."

And, he added silently, a spark igniting within him as he thought of the shimmering System interface, I'll provide results you haven't even conceived of. He pictured the Shop screen in his mind. Spirits. Void Powers. Upgrades.

Could ‘acing Master Elmsworth’s stuffy economics class’ count as a ‘normal work’ task? How many System Coins for ‘demonstrating innovative cross-border arbitrage perspectives’ (even if accidentally attributed to the non-existent Professor Grumbaldi)?

A small, almost undetectable smile touched Lloyd's lips as he returned his attention to the rapidly cooling, crest-shaped butter. Maybe this business track wouldn't be so bad after all. Especially if it funded his ascent from 'mediocre heir' to 'potentially overpowered protagonist'.

First step: figure out where the library was. He had some "studying" to do. And maybe find out if Great-Uncle Theron had any loose jewels on his portrait frame. Just in case.
