Right now, there’s something crossed my mind because I feel like I’m kind of lonely? It feels like I’m looking for something? Like, I think that you’re cheating on me? I’m assuming that you’re doing that?
 
	But I keep telling myself that you’re not like that, you won’t do it, I’m a mess right now, I don’t know what to do, my guilt that day that you discovered that I didn’t sleep for 2 days, I still carrying that guilt.
	May be, because of that I feel this way? Or I just missed you so much?
Ever since the day you said that you wouldn’t talk to me until Sunday, my thoughts just crumbled and still thinking I should’ve not said it, I should have carefully said what I will say.

Sorry Hon, I’m a mess. I just can’t stop overthinking things.
