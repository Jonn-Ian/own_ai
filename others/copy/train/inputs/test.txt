Chapter One
INTRODUCTION
1.1	Background of the Study
Technologies have a huge impact on businesses as it is providing an efficient means to make work much more simpler and enhancing business performances. Throughout the years it facilitated the growth in multiple businesses, helping in operating efficiency, security, and communication with customers.  
However, some businesses are stuck at manual processes which hinder the work. In addition, it is very important for the growing business to handle the inventory much more efficiently, and stock purchase decisions swiftly.
Additionally, LinkedIn (2023) stated that having predictive analytics to forecast an inventory demand helps to get closer to knowing what the future holds for the businesses demands and inventory needs.
LinkedIn (2023) stated that having a data visualization can help the businesses to identify the pattern trends as it is also helps the users to make a decision much more efficiently by visualizing the data that has been gathered, the users gain more insights and clarity to the user’s inventory situation as the users make more informed.
Similar to the study conducted by Lee et al. (2020), the use of AI in predictive analytics allows businesses to analyze data, detect anomalies, forecast demand, and optimize workforce efficiency, ensuring operational excellence and adaptability in dynamic markets. Additionally, by assessing inventory levels and demand trends, A.I can predict the best time to restock items, and the best amount to order. This helps businesses decrease stockouts and surplus inventory (Ali, 2024).
One of the primary advantages of AI in inventory management is increased efficiency. Businesses that automate operations like demand forecasting and replenishment may make faster, more informed choices and manage their inventory levels for optimal efficiency. AI may also assist in lowering inventory management expenses by reducing excess inventory and increasing supply chain efficiency (Ali, 2024).
As stated in an article Midway (2020) visual learning is a predominant method of information interpretation, has traditionally involved the integration of images, such as charts and graphs, alongside textual reading. 

Moreover, constructing a meaningful graph topology is important for effectively representing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing structured data (Dong et al., 2019).
Data visualization in businesses promotes way to monitor inventory monitoring and enhances collaboration and decision-making among store crews, resulting in improved inventory management efficiency. This not only streamlines operations but also fosters a culture of transparency and agility within the business.

Moving on, Detour Cafe is a business that offers "an alternate space where you can leave your worries and enjoy a cup of coffee." They have been operating since November 27, 2022, and have since opened two branches - Almar Zabarte, and Maligaya Fairview. They have 13 staff members in total, with 9 in the second branch that opened four months ago. Responsibilities are then allocated - Kitchen staff, front counter, Barista, and Dining Person. The cafe encounters an average of 70-90 customers a day, with an average revenue of ₱18,000 a day. That said, the business is in need of updated systems that can keep up with their ever-growing demand.

The business has been using Google Sheets to track their inventory, and manual computations to determine stock purchases. Ben Trapal, and Jan Yrigan, the business owners, stated that both of these outdated practices have introduced problems such as inaccuracies in inventory tracking, profit loss, and perishable food wastage for their business. In addition, Mr. Yrigan, with experience as a Burger King Assistant Restaurant Manager, is the only one tasked to decide stock purchases - making the process a hassle when he is not available. Inaccuracies in inventory tracking lead to a lack of supplies and resources resulting in a menu item being out of stock. That said, an out-of-stock menu item leads to some customers deciding not to go, resulting in profit loss. Moreover, inaccurate inventory tracking may also lead to perishable food wastage, as the computation for stock purchase decisions will be off.
The implementation of a web application with predictive analytics for accurate stock purchases will immensely help the cafe with decision-making, preventing inventory tracking inaccuracies, food wastage, and profit loss. Furthermore, the system seeks to eliminate the need to manually track inventory by utilizing data from sales listed in a Google Sheet - ultimately automating the process by scanning the Google Sheet and adjusting inventory data automatically. This system will streamline inventory management and stock purchase decision-making, presented in a cohesive web application.
This system represents an innovative and visual approach to inventory tracking and stock purchasing decisions, eliminating the need for manual processes, and ultimately automating the process. By assessing historical, market trends, and external factors, the system provides accurate forecasts of the budget needed, inventory status, and stock purchase decision-making, with the help of advanced predictive modeling. With the system’s comprehensive inventory management capabilities, it empowers Detour Cafe to better allocate budget, manpower, and efficiency.
 






1.2	Statement of the Problem
Upon the interview of the proponents with the owners of Detour Cafe, and observation of their business practices, the following are the problems that had to be addressed by the proposed web application:
1.	Which methods does the cafe use to implement decision-making in stock purchasing? Only one of the owners is authorized to handle the stocks and is tasked to forecast the inventory demand. The inadequacy of these methods prevents effective inventory management from being possible, which results in stock outs or overstocking. Without proper forecasting methods, the business will not be able to efficiently meet customer needs - leading to profit and customer loss. 
2.	How does the cafe track its stock levels using its chosen inventory method? The cafe's use of Google Sheets to manually track inventory makes the process vulnerable to inaccuracies. The process requires a staff member to manually input data into the sheet when tracking inventory, resulting in some data to be inaccurate due to human error. Furthermore, inaccurate tracking of inventory leads to errors in determining what stocks to purchase, ultimately wasting the business' budget.
3.	What are the steps they use to determine the sales performance of the cafe? Currently, the cafe does not have a system for tracking inventory management-related key performance indicators (KPIs). The absence of said system results in the lack of relevant metrics and data visualization for measuring progress, identifying strengths and weaknesses, decision-making, evaluating performance, allocating resources, and accounting.





1.3	Objectives of the Study
1.3.1	General Objective
The general objective of this study is to develop and implement a centralized system for Detour Cafe. This system will streamline inventory and sales data tracking.
1.3.2	Specific Objectives
1.3.2.1 To design a web application that automates stock purchase decision-making, based on inventory status. The system will use existing inventory data that will be calculated and interpreted to determine whether a stock purchase is necessary.
1.3.2.2 To develop a web application that automates inventory tracking using historical sales data from their own POS system, enabling the business to have accurate inventory tracking, and allocate staff members better.
1.3.2.3 To develop and implement predictive analytics to forecast inventory demand by analyzing historical data, market trends, and external factors, and to develop a way to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to inventory management and facilitate collaboration among team members through data visualization. 





1.4	Scope and Limitations
1.4.1	Scope
The study shall only cover the development of an automated Detour Cafe information system. The developers will focus on developing a system that streamlines the inventory tracking, and stock purchase decision-making of the business. It shall only be accessible to designated authorized personnels through log-in, who will then facilitate the use of the system. The system shall provide the status of the business' inventory, and the decision on whether a stock purchase is necessary. 
The system is solely for the use of Detour Cafe, specifically its Maligaya Fairview branch. To ensure security and accuracy, the system only allows designated authorized personnels, which will be given the necessary log-in credentials. The system aims to assist the cafe in managing inventory, without actually having to manually input inventory data on sheets. That said, the system will rather use the Google Sheets of sales data, analyzing each component of the sold item, and accurately adjusting inventory items accordingly. It will automate inventory tracking, and stock purchase decision-making, but not sales data tracking. Moreover, stock purchase decision making will be solely based on inventory data, which is also available on the system.
The study and its findings is limited to one branch of Detour Cafe (Maligaya, Fairview) only - it may not be possible to develop and implement on other businesses, given the difference in owners, population, facilities, logistical restrictions, and budget. Moreover, the usability of the web application may be influenced by device compatibility, internet connection, and software inconsistencies. Furthermore, the study may not be able to be effective in the long-term, beyond the partial and initial implementation phases of the system, as this would require continuous monitoring, maintenance, and dedicated personnel.

1.4.2	Limitations
This study conducted by the developers is limited to one branch of Detour Cafe only, specifically Maligaya Fairview. It is for the use of authorized staff members of the business only, who will then be trained in the use of the system.
The project focused only on tracking inventory, categorized by type, and also identified by status (Low, High). Moreover, the system shall generate forecasts for stock purchase decision-making, based on inventory data. Although these features cover important parts of inventory management, they might not cover all operational requirements or complexity seen in real-world company settings. With that being said, it could be necessary to add to or modify the system's capabilities in order to support new demands or changes in business procedures.
Furthermore, the system will handle adding, searching, viewing, and updating records, through inventory tracking and stock purchase forecasting. Hence, the reliance on historical data, market trends, and external factors for predictive analytics introduces inherent uncertainties and assumptions in the forecasting process. While efforts have been made to enhance the accuracy and reliability of these forecasts, unforeseen fluctuations or disruptions in market conditions may still impact their efficacy. Therefore, ongoing monitoring and adjustments may be necessary to ensure the continued relevance and effectiveness of the forecasting models over time. 

Figure 1: Conceptual Framework of the System
	Figure 1 shows the concept of the study on the proposed system which will focus on the development of a centralized inventory tracking system with forecasting and data visualization for Detour Cafe. The input of the system requires knowledge such as JavaScript, Mysql, and Python as well as the existing sales directory and inventory data from the cafe itself. The software requirements are visual studio code, kaggle, and xampp control panel. The process begins with the design phase where the developers create a design of the system using figma, the development phase is the stage where it involves creating an actual system followed by testing and debugging to ensure its functionality. Finally, the system is implemented and deployed. Resulting in the output of “THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CENTRALIZED INVENTORY TRACKING SYSTEM WITH FORECASTING AND DATA VISUALIZATION FOR DETOUR CAFE”: Detour Cafe inventory demand analyzer using analytics method. To evaluate the system’s quality, the ISO 25010 is applied to evaluate the system for its  functional suitability, performance efficiency, usability, reliability and portability.

First, is better tracking, delays and issues can be easily solved with an improved system for tracking. Second, better monitoring of production, by analyzing data about production, businesses will be able to know which workflow to use and cut down on waste in labor and cost. Third, with an accurate forecast of demand, companies can make sure to only reproduce those that are in demand and are gaining popularity through analyzing data from the customers. Fourth, having a responsive risk management where analytics can provide a contingency plan in case disruptions happen, and lastly, having the inventory system optimized. With an optimized inventory, it will be easy to produce reports about stock levels with consideration of data-driven insights from customers.

Challenges in Inventory Management in Businesses
An article published by Syntactics (2019) said that inventory has always been critically important because it is still considered an asset until sold therefore businesses must have a proper system to guarantee stock availability and maintain the quality of goods, minimizing extra purchases needed for unnecessary replacement of spoiled goods or replenishment at a wrong time. Moreover, businesses must always be aware of common dilemmas with inventory. The article has emphasized a few of it mainly, inefficient processes like using the old manual technique of stock inventory, lack of proper management tools that should be able to accurately monitor stocks, cash flow, and sales, problems with workplace or employees that are not properly trained, and lastly, the dynamic customer demand that always changes through time.
Combating Food Inventory Shortages with Accurate Inventory Management
According to Unilever Food Solutions (2022), supply shortages should always be kept an eye out for, and having accurate inventory management is a big advantage in combating it. Having control over stocks can lessen the disruption in case a shortage occurs. With that, Inventory management should be able to accurately track on-hand supplies such as ingredients, raw materials, and even packaging. The article also suggested having a buffer of at least 15 servings per food item in a 40-food-item menu. This is said to be applicable to medium-sized businesses. Furthermore, another factor should also be considered such as a plan for food storage. Having secured food storage can help avoid contamination, and spoilage that can cause financial loss for replenishment while also extending the shelf life of food and maximizing its value.
Demand Forecasting in Supply Chain: the Impact of Demand Volatility in the Presence of Promotion
        	Abolghasemi et al. (2020) highlight the detrimental impact of customer demand unpredictability on forecasting accuracy, upstream supply chain issues, and increased costs, underscoring the importance of demand forecasting for supply chain management (SCM). Demand forecasting not only provides crucial information for planning and decision-making but also forms the basis for various managerial decisions such as demand planning, order fulfillment, production scheduling, and inventory management. However, the complexity of demand volatility poses challenges, leading to additional expenses associated with stock-outs, inventory management, and capacity utilization, despite its insufficient attention in existing literature.
The researchers aim to understand how promotions and demand volatility influence forecasting model effectiveness and propose integrating these factors into supply chain modeling. They advocate for a hybrid model that utilizes different models for various coefficients of variation (CoV) and separates demand into baseline and promotional components. Their hybrid model, combining piecewise regression and time series models, outperforms other models in terms of accuracy, simplicity, robustness to volatility, and the ability to forecast demand, offering reliable forecasts across different levels of demand volatility.
Demand Forecasting Tool For Inventory Control Smart Systems
